1
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,914
On your feet!

2
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:14,228
An American, Colonel.

3
00:01:14,562 --> 00:01:16,564
He was at the gate, impersonating an officer.

4
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:24,238
You were alone?

5
00:01:25,823 --> 00:01:28,701
Spy, you were alone?

6
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:30,370
I like to be alone.

7
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:33,456
What did you come here for?

8
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,709
You got a lot of nice stuff.

9
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:38,211
Other people's stuff.

10
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,964
"To the victor belongs the spoils."

11
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:44,425
"To the victor"?

12
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:46,928
Berlin's in rubble.

13
00:01:47,136 --> 00:01:48,680
The Führer's in hiding.

14
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:51,641
You lost.

15
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:56,979
Take him upstairs.

16
00:01:57,605 --> 00:01:58,481
What? What?

17
00:01:58,648 --> 00:01:59,607
Hey!

18
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:00,775
Hey, wait a second. Guys!

19
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:02,318
A moment. Please!

20
00:02:03,027 --> 00:02:04,612
Stop! I must speak to the commander.

21
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:06,739
Colonel. I found it!

22
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:10,201
Do as he says. Open it.

23
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:16,582
Doctor.

24
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:26,634
The Lance of Longinus.

25
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:30,471
The blade that drew Christ's blood.

26
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:32,598
The Holy Lance.

27
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:44,986
Double the guard.
This is the prize the Führer seeks.

28
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:46,029
Colonel, we need to talk.

29
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,447
No time, Doctor.

30
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:48,990
The train to Berlin is waiting.

31
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:51,326
Search the woods!

32
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:52,452
Take the dogs.

33
00:02:53,578 --> 00:02:54,912
Do you think that spy was alone?

34
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,040
Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!

35
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:58,082
On the double!

36
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,527
Looks like they're leaving without you guys.

37
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,948
Tell us your story, or die.

38
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:31,574
Story.

39
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:34,744
Okay, okay.

40
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:35,870
Well...

41
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:38,331
it all started...

42
00:03:38,915 --> 00:03:43,002
once upon a time,
when this village...

43
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:47,674
of stupid blue-eyed boys
decided to join hands together...

44
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,094
and follow this sweaty little pied piper
named Adolf...

45
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:12,240
No.

46
00:05:30,902 --> 00:05:32,987
This man was with the American.

47
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:35,823
This is the American's bag.

48
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,660
What have I done?

49
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:44,624
Bring him to my carriage.

50
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:55,260
Careful. This is the Führer's special relic!

51
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:26,124
Stay seated.

52
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,334
So...

53
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:33,089
you are a birdwatcher?

54
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:38,720
Yes. Because of the bombing,

55
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,598
the wagtails are following
a completely different trajectory.

56
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,270
We caught your accomplice.

57
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:49,939
The American.

58
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,548
Oh, my!

59
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:24,033
Get off of me!

60
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:54,939
There's one reason you're still alive,
birdwatcher.

61
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,110
Who sent you?

62
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:00,487
What was your mission?

63
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:02,697
Please, Colonel, no. I beg you.

64
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:05,116
My name is Basil Shaw.

65
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:08,078
I'm a professor at Oxford.

66
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:09,871
An archeologist.

67
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,505
There you are.

68
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:24,719
There is a problem.

69
00:09:25,762 --> 00:09:27,013
I must speak to the Colonel.

70
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:29,265
It's urgent.

71
00:09:31,726 --> 00:09:33,603
I have a daughter. I beg you.

72
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,981
I guarantee you will never see
your child again, Mr. Shaw.

73
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:43,238
Unless you explain
why your accomplice had this.

74
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:09,931
We were told that the Lance of Longinus
could be found at the fortress.

75
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:11,766
We were looking for it.

76
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:13,810
Why?

77
00:10:15,311 --> 00:10:16,354
Because of its power?

78
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,191
It has no power.

79
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:25,447
My friend and I were trying to save history.

80
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:29,576
I must speak with the Colonel.

81
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:31,911
It's about the Lance.

82
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,043
I only had a moment to look at it.

83
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:21,961
Of course, my training is in physics,

84
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:24,422
For God's sake, spit it out!

85
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:27,258
The Lance...

86
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,638
It's a fake.

87
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:33,098
It's a fake.

88
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:34,599
A fake?

89
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:38,395
The blade is an alloy.

90
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:39,980
Fifty years old,

91
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:42,273
the engravings recent. It's a replica.

92
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:43,400
We're dead.

93
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:48,530
Twelfth century. Thirteenth century.

94
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,865
Ramesses II.

95
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,994
None of this stuff is fake.

96
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,331
I gotta stop this train.

97
00:11:58,748 --> 00:12:00,083
There is another relic on this train.

98
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:02,585
One with real power.

99
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:04,254
What are you talking about?

100
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:07,215
The Antikythera.

101
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:08,633
The Antikythera?!

102
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,802
Enough about that old dial!

103
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:13,221
Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...

104
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:15,015
and his mind!

105
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,560
Let me explain.

106
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,064
The Antikythera's power is not supernatural.

107
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,317
It is mathematics.

108
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,528
Whoever harnesses it...

109
00:12:30,614 --> 00:12:32,198
will not be King...

110
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:33,908
nor Emperor...

111
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:36,494
or Führer.

112
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:41,833
He will be God.

113
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,853
Too many Nazis.

114
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,276
And how do you propose we tell him this?

115
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:09,778
My Führer,

116
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,364
I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.

117
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:13,865
But here is...

118
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:18,036
half of something you've never heard of.

119
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:20,497
Tell me,

120
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:22,457
have you ever MET HITLER?!!

121
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:26,127
A saboteur aboard.

122
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:27,629
And Hitler's Lance is gone.

123
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:10,255
That way!

124
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:15,176
What are you doing here?!

125
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:23,310
What the hell?

126
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:26,229
Indy?

127
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:27,230
Baz?

128
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:28,481
You're alive!

129
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:30,275
So far.

130
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:33,361
I thought I told you
to stay in the woods, Baz.

131
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:37,574
What sort of a man hides in a hedge
while his friend is facing death?

132
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:54,466
This lot are carting off
half the world's antiquities.

133
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:57,677
I was gonna stop 'em,
but now I've gotta rescue you.

134
00:14:58,386 --> 00:14:59,763
Did you at least find the Lance?

135
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:02,057
-"At least"?
-Well, have you got it?

136
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:03,433
It's a fake.

137
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:04,434
What?

138
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:06,436
A reproduction.

139
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,940
Who are you?

140
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:15,445
Indy?

141
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:25,789
The Antikythera.

142
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:28,667
Archimedes' Dial.

143
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,211
Bring it.

144
00:15:48,937 --> 00:15:50,063
Hurry up, Baz.

145
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:54,401
Give me that.

146
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:55,652
Come on.

147
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,835
Get up, Baz.

148
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:13,295
Follow me.

149
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,255
Towards the gun?

150
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:16,673
Away from the Nazis!

151
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,050
Those are Nazis!

152
00:16:19,593 --> 00:16:21,595
Get down! Down! Down!

153
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:12,062
This way. Come on!

154
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:13,563
I can't do that!

155
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:15,649
You wanna stop for a little lie-down?

156
00:17:19,486 --> 00:17:20,821
They have the Antikythera!

157
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:23,323
Easy.

158
00:17:54,396 --> 00:17:55,188
Tunnel!

159
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:07,534
Got you! No!

160
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:49,201
Indy!

161
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:58,460
Get the gun!

162
00:19:07,678 --> 00:19:09,012
Shoot him!

163
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:13,016
Not me!

164
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:15,185
Sorry.

165
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,540
To the victor go the spoils.

166
00:20:07,487 --> 00:20:09,239
Drop the gun.

167
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,493
Give me the Antikythera.

168
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:25,964
Indy!

169
00:20:36,892 --> 00:20:37,726
Hey!

170
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:43,148
-Here!
-They can't hear you, Baz.

171
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:45,067
We gotta jump!

172
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:46,652
What about my dicky knee?

173
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:54,576
Baz!

174
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:56,495
Baz!

175
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,373
Baz!

176
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:02,417
-Indy!
-Baz!

177
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:09,132
Go! Move! Move it!

178
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:13,804
Bit rum to go home empty-handed
after all that.

179
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:15,639
"Empty-handed"?

180
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:17,099
Not exactly.

181
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:21,019
Archimedes' Dial.

182
00:21:21,186 --> 00:21:22,229
Well, half of it.

183
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:24,606
Come on, Baz. Let's get home.

184
00:22:29,963 --> 00:22:32,591
Larry! Turn it down!

185
00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:34,885
Turn it down!

186
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:36,887
Hey, Larry!

187
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:52,653
Larry!

188
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:54,988
Larry!

189
00:22:55,113 --> 00:22:56,782
-Hi, Mr. Jones.
-Where's Larry?

190
00:22:58,075 --> 00:22:58,825
Who is this guy?

191
00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:00,077
It's the old guy next door.

192
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:01,912
Larry, it's 8:00 in the morning.

193
00:23:02,037 --> 00:23:04,456
-"It's 8:00 in the morning."
-We talked about this, Larry.

194
00:23:04,581 --> 00:23:05,541
Yeah, but that was...

195
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:08,168
-a workday, Mr. Jones.
-This is a workday too, Larry!

196
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:10,754
Turn on the news.

197
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:12,214
It's moon day, Mr. Jones.

198
00:23:13,423 --> 00:23:14,633
Moon day?

199
00:24:07,978 --> 00:24:08,854
Thanks.

200
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:24,203
All you really need to remember...

201
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:27,956
is that Assyrian ceramics of this period
are characterized...

202
00:24:28,123 --> 00:24:32,085
by this complex blue-line pattern.

203
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:33,253
Okay?

204
00:24:34,338 --> 00:24:37,758
I assigned pages 131 through 171...

205
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:39,551
in Winford for today.

206
00:24:39,718 --> 00:24:41,220
Anybody do the reading?

207
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,556
Anyone?

208
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:49,353
Gosh, this is on the test.

209
00:24:49,561 --> 00:24:50,771
Okay.

210
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:53,982
Guess I'll spoon-feed it to you.

211
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,404
In 213 BC...

212
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:01,615
Roman forces led by Marcellus...

213
00:25:01,824 --> 00:25:04,618
laid siege to the city of Syracuse.

214
00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:06,453
"Syracuse."

215
00:25:07,913 --> 00:25:10,541
Not the Syracuse in New York, Tonya.

216
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:12,251
The one in Sicily.

217
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:15,421
Amongst the defenders of the city...

218
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:18,715
was its most famous resident, who was...

219
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:22,594
Come on, guys. This is on the final.

220
00:25:23,262 --> 00:25:24,930
Archimedes.

221
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:26,849
Archimedes.

222
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:28,308
Archimedes, who was a...

223
00:25:28,434 --> 00:25:29,601
A mathematician.

224
00:25:29,768 --> 00:25:30,936
A mathematician.

225
00:25:31,103 --> 00:25:33,689
But more than that, an inventor...

226
00:25:33,856 --> 00:25:36,358
a brilliant engineer...

227
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:40,904
who conceived of a way to harness the energy
of the Mediterranean sun...

228
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:43,782
on concave mirrors and focus it...

229
00:25:43,949 --> 00:25:46,577
on attacking Roman warships
and set them on fire.

230
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:50,205
Who devised giant iron claws...

231
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,000
that could snatch hostiles from the sea.

232
00:25:55,544 --> 00:25:58,422
But how do we know it really happened?

233
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,594
What physical, irrefutable
archeological evidence...

234
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:07,056
-is there of these inventions?
-The Antikythera.

235
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,642
-The Antikythera.
-For starters.

236
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:12,811
They're here! They're downtown!

237
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,106
The astronauts.

238
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:18,567
Giant parade this morning will be seen...

239
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:21,862
by about two and a half million people
lining the sidewalks...

240
00:26:24,907 --> 00:26:26,325
He's coming. He's come. See?

241
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:27,910
Oh, here he comes.

242
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:29,912
Hide the cake.

243
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:33,707
-Surprise.
-Surprise!

244
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:39,004
For over a decade now...

245
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:43,634
our colleague Dr. Jones has been
a loyal servant of Hunter.

246
00:26:45,094 --> 00:26:46,637
A token of our gratitude.

247
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:54,937
Wow.

248
00:26:59,274 --> 00:27:01,193
Thanks for putting up with me.

249
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:16,458
Here.

250
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:28,220
Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins,
and Buzz Aldrin...

251
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:30,347
will not be able to avoid the spotlight.

252
00:27:30,472 --> 00:27:34,226
At 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
a grateful nation will pay homage...

253
00:27:34,393 --> 00:27:37,021
with a ticker-tape parade
through New York and Chicago...

254
00:27:37,187 --> 00:27:38,731
climaxed by a dinner in Los Angeles...

255
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:40,149
What would the ancients say?

256
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:42,443
Neil, Buzz, and Mike...

257
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:45,321
If they knew we walked on the moon?

258
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:47,072
Speaking as an ancient...

259
00:27:47,197 --> 00:27:49,742
going to the moon is like going to Reno.

260
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:51,201
Middle of nowhere...

261
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:53,871
and no blackjack.

262
00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:56,457
You don't recognize me, do you?

263
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,878
Whatever I did, I apologize.

264
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:02,880
It's Helena.

265
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:05,507
Helena Shaw.

266
00:28:07,343 --> 00:28:08,552
Wombat?

267
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:10,346
Wow, I haven't heard that in a while.

268
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:12,640
-You got tall.
-I did.

269
00:28:12,848 --> 00:28:14,141
It's fair to say.

270
00:28:16,226 --> 00:28:17,311
I'm celebrating.

271
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:20,606
-I'm retiring.
-Oh.

272
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,608
Wow.
Well, in that case, what are we drinking?

273
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:29,823
Room service for Mr. Schmidt.

274
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:43,295
Put that away.

275
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,297
I was asking how you broke your ankle.

276
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:47,049
None of your business.

277
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:48,133
Are you Mr. Schmidt?

278
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:50,386
"Doctor" Schmidt. He's in there.

279
00:28:50,552 --> 00:28:53,347
And he don't eat anything on wheels,
so put it on a table.

280
00:28:54,848 --> 00:28:56,100
When I was a little boy...

281
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,810
I always imagined...

282
00:28:57,977 --> 00:29:01,647
that one day man would walk on the moon.

283
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:03,274
And by golly...

284
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:11,615
Quite a celebration out there.

285
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:16,537
The man you're servin'...

286
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:18,998
he's the one who put those astronauts
on the moon.

287
00:29:19,164 --> 00:29:20,207
Built the rockets they rode in.

288
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,918
Congratulations.

289
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,169
Where are you from?

290
00:29:25,254 --> 00:29:26,088
The Bronx, sir.

291
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:28,215
No, no. I mean originally, your people.

292
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,300
Do you know?

293
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:35,639
I was born by Yankee Stadium, sir.

294
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,102
And you fought for your country?

295
00:29:41,061 --> 00:29:42,479
320th Battalion.

296
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:45,024
Set up balloons to stop the planes
bombing Normandy.

297
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:52,323
And are you enjoying your victory?

298
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:01,290
Will there be anything else?

299
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:05,002
You didn't win the war.

300
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,838
Hitler lost it.

301
00:30:13,385 --> 00:30:14,261
Yeah.

302
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:18,265
My field agent, she found Shaw.

303
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:20,392
Yeah, I'm comin'.

304
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,560
Let's go, Hauke.

305
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:26,232
Where are we here?

306
00:30:27,316 --> 00:30:29,235
Oxford. In the garden.

307
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,363
He was an original.

308
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:36,200
I just graduated.

309
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:37,326
In Archeology.

310
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:40,412
Archeology. Wow.

311
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:42,206
Apple didn't fall far.

312
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:45,084
Well, now I'm researching a doctorate.

313
00:30:46,293 --> 00:30:47,294
What's your subject?

314
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:50,089
The Archimedes Dial.

315
00:30:50,673 --> 00:30:52,174
The Antikythera.

316
00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:56,428
What do you know about that?

317
00:30:56,971 --> 00:30:58,305
Well, for starters...

318
00:30:58,472 --> 00:31:01,892
in 1902, Greek sponge divers found
a wrecked Roman warship...

319
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,352
huge, off the coast of Greece.

320
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:05,729
Below deck, sealed in wax...

321
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:07,398
was a clock-like mechanism...

322
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,401
finely tooled, purpose unknown.

323
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:14,530
Nothing approximating its complexity appears
in the world for 1,000 years.

324
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:17,783
-You've done your homework.
-Well, not me.

325
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:20,995
Dad. He had all these journals,
reams of notes about it.

326
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:22,997
He was obsessed till the end.

327
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,836
He told me you found it
on a Nazi plunder train.

328
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:33,382
And then lost it in a river
in the French Alps.

329
00:31:36,218 --> 00:31:37,386
Well, that was a long time ago.

330
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:38,971
And it was only half the Dial.

331
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,639
-Archimedes...
-Archimedes broke the Dial in two...

332
00:31:40,806 --> 00:31:41,765
-...disassembled it.
-...and then hid...

333
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:43,976
the two halves from the Romans
during the siege of Syracuse.

334
00:31:44,143 --> 00:31:45,394
I know. Look.

335
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,355
You don't remember the last time I saw you,
do you?

336
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:51,108
Remember what?

337
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:52,193
These are the Alps.

338
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,237
Yeah, I see.

339
00:31:55,404 --> 00:31:57,281
And this is the route that your train took...

340
00:31:57,406 --> 00:31:59,408
-from the Nazi stronghold in '44.
-Right.

341
00:31:59,492 --> 00:32:01,368
It went through this mountain pass...

342
00:32:01,494 --> 00:32:02,995
and then here.

343
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:05,414
-Here, it's the only river on the route.
-Right.

344
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:06,624
Under a bridge.

345
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:08,167
It's down there. It's got to be.

346
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:10,753
-And nobody knows except us.
-"Us"?

347
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:12,546
Well, I mean, you.

348
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,256
And me. So, yeah.

349
00:32:14,423 --> 00:32:16,258
-Us.
-Us.

350
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:19,762
And what were you thinking exactly?

351
00:32:21,263 --> 00:32:22,348
Well, that maybe...

352
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:25,643
we could go there.

353
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,852
And?

354
00:32:27,102 --> 00:32:28,187
And find it.

355
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:30,689
And I'd become...

356
00:32:32,358 --> 00:32:33,484
famous.

357
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:34,944
Oh, well, not famous.

358
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,945
Renowned. Feted.

359
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:38,322
A feted archeologist.

360
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:40,241
And you, a final triumph!

361
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:41,325
Indiana Jones!

362
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,494
Out with a bang! Back in the saddle!

363
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,040
I'm not selling this, am I?

364
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,669
Wombat...

365
00:32:53,796 --> 00:32:55,673
why are you chasing the thing...

366
00:32:57,466 --> 00:32:59,510
that drove your father crazy?

367
00:33:05,474 --> 00:33:06,892
Wouldn't you?

368
00:33:25,244 --> 00:33:26,078
I got it.

369
00:33:26,245 --> 00:33:27,204
Parade's comin' soon.

370
00:33:28,414 --> 00:33:29,248
So, what we got?

371
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:33,377
She's in there, third floor, with an old guy.

372
00:33:33,502 --> 00:33:34,628
Who is he, a Russian?

373
00:33:34,837 --> 00:33:36,714
No, a professor. Dr. Henry Jones.

374
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,799
Klaber!

375
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:41,469
Klaber, get back here! You're not an agent!

376
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:42,845
Goddammit!
Go.

377
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:45,639
I'll get support up here
and pull a file on Jones.

378
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:07,578
This way.

379
00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:46,784
Basil became obsessed by this German theory.

380
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:49,662
Conjecture, really.

381
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,583
Archimedes had figured out...

382
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:56,919
that the movements of the moon and planets...

383
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,004
weren't perfect.

384
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:02,800
There were irregularities in their rotations.

385
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,262
He thought these irregularities might...

386
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:09,807
explain fluctuations in temperature, tides.

387
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:13,269
Storms, even.

388
00:35:14,603 --> 00:35:17,523
So, he set about building a device
to predict them.

389
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:23,112
But then, he stumbled upon a method
to predict even larger...

390
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:24,822
disturbances.

391
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:28,159
Larger disturbances?

392
00:35:28,784 --> 00:35:30,995
Your father thought this thing could...

393
00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:33,956
predict fissures in time.

394
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:52,516
Hauke, if you don't...

395
00:35:54,894 --> 00:35:55,978
Found 'em.

396
00:36:04,654 --> 00:36:05,571
Hello.

397
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:08,949
Are you looking for...

398
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,368
Dr. Jones?

399
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:15,247
Excuse me, can I help you?

400
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:16,749
No, thank you.

401
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,668
Just a routine investigation, ma'am.

402
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,213
Are you the police?

403
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,673
It'll just be a few moments.

404
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,675
-Professor Plimpton.
-Ma'am.

405
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,009
-Professor Plimpton!
-Ma'am!

406
00:36:31,555 --> 00:36:32,431
Drop your weapon.

407
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:33,724
What the hell are you doin'?

408
00:36:35,017 --> 00:36:37,103
What the doctor tells me, Miss Mason.

409
00:36:37,353 --> 00:36:38,187
Mandy?

410
00:36:42,942 --> 00:36:44,986
Yeah, no witnesses.

411
00:36:49,365 --> 00:36:51,450
Jesus. What the hell?

412
00:36:51,701 --> 00:36:55,037
Your father wrote so many letters
about the Dial, I stopped reading 'em.

413
00:36:58,165 --> 00:37:00,835
You really don't remember the last time
I was at your house?

414
00:37:02,837 --> 00:37:04,755
I took that from him then.

415
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,050
I thought he'd stopped thinking about it.

416
00:37:08,217 --> 00:37:12,096
But your father was convinced this thing
was real and dangerous.

417
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,265
Do not shoot.

418
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,060
He was terrified that if somebody found
this legendary tablet,

419
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,395
the Grafikos...

420
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,689
The tablet containing directions
to the rest of the Dial.

421
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:22,940
And if they found the Grafikos...

422
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:24,734
they might acquire the other half
of the Dial...

423
00:37:24,817 --> 00:37:25,735
and put the two together.

424
00:37:27,403 --> 00:37:28,613
I knew you wouldn't destroy it.

425
00:37:32,158 --> 00:37:34,035
How did you know he asked me to destroy it?

426
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:35,369
What?

427
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:36,912
You do remember that night.

428
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:41,083
-I was 12 years old, Indy.
-You knew we didn't drop it in a river.

429
00:37:41,876 --> 00:37:43,002
Baz didn't tell you that.

430
00:37:43,169 --> 00:37:45,171
-See, listen. I didn't...
-No, he never lied.

431
00:37:45,713 --> 00:37:48,049
-No. You...
-What was all that crap about the map?

432
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,342
No, you've had too many whiskeys.

433
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,052
What are you doing, Wombat?

434
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,470
Stay where you are.

435
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:54,805
Don't move.

436
00:37:55,598 --> 00:37:57,016
-Who are these people?
-We need to get out of here.

437
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,017
Are they with you?

438
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,352
Not an inch, Miss Shaw.

439
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:01,687
Miss Shaw, stop!

440
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:05,858
Helena!

441
00:38:11,364 --> 00:38:12,114
Stop!

442
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:15,117
Sorry.

443
00:38:15,368 --> 00:38:16,118
Helena!

444
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:18,120
Dr. Jones. It's over.

445
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:19,580
Who are you people?

446
00:38:19,747 --> 00:38:20,831
What do you want?

447
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,668
Stop!

448
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:26,629
Helena Shaw!

449
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,047
She's on the roof. Find another way up.

450
00:38:28,214 --> 00:38:29,048
Dr. Jones!

451
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,259
Dr. Jones, we're not gonna hurt you.

452
00:38:57,785 --> 00:39:00,288
-Move. We gotta follow 'em.
-Go. Hurry up.

453
00:39:27,857 --> 00:39:28,733
Fan out!

454
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,248
-Let's go. Move, move, move! Pack it up!
-Come on. Get everything.

455
00:39:44,457 --> 00:39:45,541
Found her!

456
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,280
-Operator.
-I need the police.

457
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:18,783
Hunter College. People are dead.

458
00:40:18,908 --> 00:40:19,951
-Please...
-Hang up, fella.

459
00:40:25,915 --> 00:40:26,833
Stand up.

460
00:40:32,421 --> 00:40:33,381
Okay, okay.

461
00:40:57,864 --> 00:40:59,323
She's gone. You blew it...

462
00:40:59,532 --> 00:41:00,741
you trigger-happy cracker.

463
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:03,369
-She had it in her hand.
-We got the professor.

464
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:08,082
Here's the file on Jones.

465
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:09,167
Yes.

466
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:28,561
Who are you?

467
00:41:28,728 --> 00:41:30,104
That's my question.

468
00:41:40,656 --> 00:41:42,116
You're CIA.

469
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:44,035
Oh, not me, man.

470
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,162
I don't take government jobs.

471
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:47,163
Okay.

472
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,875
How are you acquainted with Miss Shaw?

473
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,543
She's my goddaughter.

474
00:41:53,252 --> 00:41:54,879
I haven't seen her in 18 years.

475
00:41:55,004 --> 00:41:57,173
Why did you meet with her today?
To give her the Dial?

476
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:01,052
Lady, it's an ancient hunk of gears.

477
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,012
Half a hunk.

478
00:42:03,137 --> 00:42:04,889
Oh, it's a lot more than that.

479
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,642
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

480
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,060
Where do you think you're going?

481
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:10,603
I got a parade going on.

482
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,230
And a demonstration coming down here.

483
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,439
Hey! Hey, hey!

484
00:42:14,107 --> 00:42:15,149
-Hey...
-Shut up.

485
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:17,735
I can't go this way. Gotta go back.

486
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:24,450
Hell no! What is wrong with you, man?

487
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,244
Damn it!
Let's go on foot.

488
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:27,245
You heard her.

489
00:42:29,288 --> 00:42:30,206
What the hell were you thinking?

490
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:31,666
-Walk! Come on.
-What is your problem?

491
00:42:31,874 --> 00:42:33,334
-You don't look when you're backin' up?
-Take care of that guy.

492
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:34,293
Who's gonna pay for that?

493
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:35,628
Easy, fella. Easy.

494
00:42:35,795 --> 00:42:36,546
Keep movin'.

495
00:42:36,712 --> 00:42:38,423
Can't you see my cab? It's yellow.

496
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,633
No, you're gonna have to pay
for this bodywork, man. I don't...

497
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:45,430
Peace now! Peace now!

498
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:49,726
Stop the war! Stop the fighting!

499
00:42:49,892 --> 00:42:51,644
-Where are we going, Mason?
-This way.

500
00:42:53,646 --> 00:42:55,231
-Hell no, we won't go.
-Shut up.

501
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:56,858
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no!

502
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,736
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no, we won't go!

503
00:42:59,902 --> 00:43:00,778
We won't go!

504
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:03,322
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no, we won't go!

505
00:43:03,906 --> 00:43:05,324
-Hell no...
-Shut up!

506
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,492
Hell yeah!

507
00:43:16,502 --> 00:43:17,503
Hell no...

508
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:29,307
Hey!

509
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:32,185
Officer! Help me!

510
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,479
Officer, there was a shooting...

511
00:43:34,687 --> 00:43:36,481
-All right, all right.
-...this morning at Hunter.

512
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:38,358
People are dead. God damn it.

513
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:41,944
-Some rogue maniacs broke in and...
-Sir, you need to calm it down.

514
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:43,237
Please listen to me.

515
00:43:43,404 --> 00:43:45,531
There was a shooting this morning, and the...

516
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,160
They're in a Con Ed van
right around the corner!

517
00:43:51,746 --> 00:43:53,373
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

518
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,928
-Watch out!
-What's he doin'?

519
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,825
You did it!

520
00:44:56,144 --> 00:44:57,145
Move, out the way!

521
00:45:05,278 --> 00:45:06,154
Watch out!

522
00:45:08,448 --> 00:45:09,615
Move! Quickly!

523
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,298
Move! Move!

524
00:45:35,892 --> 00:45:37,226
Go, go, go!

525
00:45:57,872 --> 00:46:00,541
Come on. That's ridiculous. It's a horse.

526
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:01,542
Come on!

527
00:46:04,045 --> 00:46:05,922
-Hey, mister.
-Move! Out of the way!

528
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:07,090
Hold my horse.

529
00:46:07,215 --> 00:46:08,299
Move! Move!

530
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:11,261
Transfer is available
for IND Queens Boulevard.

531
00:46:20,687 --> 00:46:23,690
Next stop, 59th, Lexington Avenue.

532
00:46:25,566 --> 00:46:26,859
Subway is faster.

533
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:32,156
People tend to romanticize science,
when it is, in fact, quite cold.

534
00:46:32,282 --> 00:46:33,866
So, what's next, Dr. Schmidt?

535
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:35,910
Mars?

536
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:38,288
No, we've conquered space.

537
00:46:40,123 --> 00:46:41,791
I'm moving to the next frontier.

538
00:46:43,293 --> 00:46:45,670
What's beyond space?

539
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:52,302
You might wanna get that suit pressed,
Dr. Schmidt.

540
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:54,512
We leave for the airport in an hour.

541
00:46:54,971 --> 00:46:56,055
He's gonna meet the President.

542
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,640
If the President objects to a few creases...

543
00:46:57,891 --> 00:47:00,143
perhaps he should find himself
another physicist.

544
00:47:01,144 --> 00:47:02,979
-Can I use that?
-No.

545
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:04,188
Yes.

546
00:47:05,899 --> 00:47:06,691
Baxter.

547
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:11,821
It's for you, Doctor.

548
00:47:15,575 --> 00:47:17,619
I may wanna leave a bit later
for Los Angeles.

549
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:20,079
I'm expecting a delivery shortly.

550
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:24,167
Speak.

551
00:47:24,292 --> 00:47:25,752
Your goons made a mess.

552
00:47:26,002 --> 00:47:27,170
Did they?

553
00:47:27,337 --> 00:47:29,672
Miss Shaw met with a professor. Jones.

554
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,133
She acquired the device from him.

555
00:47:33,009 --> 00:47:34,093
Then we lost her.

556
00:47:35,762 --> 00:47:37,430
Dr. Jones got away as well.

557
00:47:37,847 --> 00:47:39,015
Is that so?

558
00:47:39,182 --> 00:47:40,516
Most unfortunate.

559
00:47:40,934 --> 00:47:42,435
I gotta clean things up here, Doctor.

560
00:47:42,644 --> 00:47:44,938
And as a representative
of the United States government...

561
00:47:45,104 --> 00:47:46,773
I urge you to cooperate.

562
00:47:46,981 --> 00:47:48,191
Get on that plane to Los Angeles...

563
00:47:49,108 --> 00:47:50,360
and get your medal from the President.

564
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,743
Hello?

565
00:47:59,536 --> 00:48:01,704
Call our friends
and secure a private charter.

566
00:48:03,122 --> 00:48:04,040
To Morocco.

567
00:48:04,207 --> 00:48:05,375
Yes, sir.

568
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:09,462
The university murders took place
at the height of the parade.

569
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:13,132
Police are searching for retired professor
Dr. Henry Jones.

570
00:48:13,299 --> 00:48:16,302
A colleague told ABC
that Jones recently lost his son...

571
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:18,429
and was in the middle of a divorce.

572
00:48:21,182 --> 00:48:23,810
This guy, he looks like you.

573
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:27,188
Nah. No.

574
00:48:29,148 --> 00:48:30,149
It is you.

575
00:48:30,316 --> 00:48:31,150
No, no, no. Hey.

576
00:48:31,317 --> 00:48:32,819
-Go home, pal. You're drunk.
-This is the guy!

577
00:48:33,027 --> 00:48:34,279
-Hey!
-It's the killer!

578
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,366
Sorry I'm late, Indy.

579
00:48:38,491 --> 00:48:39,993
Bridge traffic.

580
00:48:50,837 --> 00:48:53,006
Boy, am I glad to see you, Sallah.

581
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,842
I wish I could say the same, old friend.

582
00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:01,097
Quickly, Indy. Inside.

583
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:07,187
Your goddaughter, Helena...

584
00:49:07,353 --> 00:49:09,981
was arrested in Tangier last year...

585
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:12,859
for auctioning contraband.

586
00:49:15,403 --> 00:49:16,321
There's more.

587
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:20,909
She was bailed out by Aziz Rahim.

588
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,454
Aziz Rahim is the son of Big Rahim...

589
00:49:24,621 --> 00:49:27,415
a well-known Moroccan mobster.

590
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,587
Big Rahim owns the Hotel Atlantique...

591
00:49:32,754 --> 00:49:35,423
in Tangier, and this week...

592
00:49:35,548 --> 00:49:39,677
the hotel is hosting its annual auction...

593
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:41,721
of stolen antiquities.

594
00:49:42,889 --> 00:49:45,391
All the big players are already there.

595
00:49:45,517 --> 00:49:47,352
Alia, Jabari.

596
00:49:47,477 --> 00:49:51,648
This is the great man who brought our family
to America during the war.

597
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:54,275
Quick, when was the Suez Crisis?

598
00:49:55,151 --> 00:49:56,736
1956.

599
00:49:57,278 --> 00:49:58,613
Very impressive, Jabari.

600
00:49:58,738 --> 00:50:01,241
My grandchildren watch too much TV...

601
00:50:01,407 --> 00:50:03,868
but they know their history.

602
00:50:04,077 --> 00:50:08,206
They understand what it is
to be American and Egyptian.

603
00:50:09,082 --> 00:50:11,251
I need a ride to the airport, Sallah.

604
00:50:12,335 --> 00:50:14,838
If you run, the police will assume
that you're guilty.

605
00:50:15,505 --> 00:50:18,842
Without Helena or the Dial,
I'm gonna get framed for murder.

606
00:50:20,093 --> 00:50:21,636
Have you thought about calling Marion?

607
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,097
She doesn't wanna talk to me.

608
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:33,857
Welcome to New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport.

609
00:50:34,691 --> 00:50:36,985
The upper level is for Pan American Airlines
passenger drop off only.

610
00:50:37,193 --> 00:50:38,987
I took something else from your apartment.

611
00:50:39,195 --> 00:50:40,363
It was under the bed.

612
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:46,578
Thanks, Sallah.

613
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,665
I also brought my passport.

614
00:50:52,709 --> 00:50:53,877
I could help you.

615
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:54,961
In Tangier?

616
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,796
Wherever chance takes us.

617
00:50:57,714 --> 00:50:58,798
Indy, I...

618
00:50:59,716 --> 00:51:01,176
I miss the desert.

619
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,094
I miss the sea.

620
00:51:04,554 --> 00:51:06,389
And I miss waking up every morning...

621
00:51:06,556 --> 00:51:09,642
wondering what wonderful adventure
the new day will bring to us.

622
00:51:10,602 --> 00:51:12,645
This is not an adventure, Sallah.

623
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:16,691
Those days have come and gone.

624
00:51:16,816 --> 00:51:17,859
Perhaps.

625
00:51:18,068 --> 00:51:19,444
Perhaps not.

626
00:51:23,865 --> 00:51:26,493
Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!

627
00:51:38,088 --> 00:51:38,922
Champagne?

628
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:41,466
We've got four more hours to Tangier.

629
00:51:49,182 --> 00:51:50,600
Your scotch, sir.

630
00:51:51,226 --> 00:51:52,268
Thanks.

631
00:51:59,192 --> 00:52:00,568
Basil. Come on, Baz!

632
00:52:00,652 --> 00:52:02,487
-Open the door!
-No!

633
00:52:02,654 --> 00:52:04,114
-Stay out, Indy!
-Open the door.

634
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:09,202
The Germans were right, Indy.

635
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:11,663
-What?
-It's too big. It's too much.

636
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:12,664
Hey, Ba...
Hey, hey!

637
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:14,624
-Hey, Baz! Give me...
-No.

638
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:16,876
-What are you doing?
-You've listened to nothing that I said.

639
00:52:17,043 --> 00:52:18,795
I don't understand it, Baz!

640
00:52:19,212 --> 00:52:21,172
Well, I was trying to explain it
to you downstairs.

641
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:23,591
-You've just ignored everything.
-You're terrifying your daughter.

642
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:27,804
Indy, Archimedes...

643
00:52:27,971 --> 00:52:30,223
discovered a temporal meteorology.

644
00:52:30,473 --> 00:52:33,018
Archimedes was a mathematician, Baz...

645
00:52:33,226 --> 00:52:34,436
not a magician.

646
00:52:34,644 --> 00:52:37,063
He could predict fissures in time.

647
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,773
Fissures in time?

648
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:42,235
-Baz, you can't prove that!
-Well, not yet.

649
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,279
Proving it is what makes it science!

650
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:00,712
Oh, Baz.

651
00:53:02,422 --> 00:53:03,965
I never should've given you the thing.

652
00:53:04,674 --> 00:53:06,217
It belongs in a museum.

653
00:53:07,093 --> 00:53:08,762
Give it to me. Please.

654
00:53:12,432 --> 00:53:13,725
If I give you this...

655
00:53:14,934 --> 00:53:16,478
it must be destroyed.

656
00:53:17,896 --> 00:53:18,813
I will.

657
00:53:21,691 --> 00:53:23,026
I'll destroy it, Baz.

658
00:53:25,612 --> 00:53:26,571
Promise.

659
00:53:32,702 --> 00:53:34,245
I'm sorry about this.

660
00:53:34,412 --> 00:53:35,580
It's all my fault.

661
00:53:37,749 --> 00:53:39,167
-Are you gonna be here?
-Yes, sir.

662
00:53:39,376 --> 00:53:41,461
Okay. I've gotta catch an airplane.

663
00:53:41,628 --> 00:53:44,422
If anyone finds the Grafikos,
they'll have both halves.

664
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:45,882
Some things should stay buried.

665
00:53:46,007 --> 00:53:46,800
I know, Baz.

666
00:53:46,967 --> 00:53:48,760
-It's vital that you destroy it.
-I will, Baz.

667
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,303
-Do you understand?
-I'll destroy it.

668
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:51,221
-Say you will, Indy.
-Yes.

669
00:53:51,388 --> 00:53:52,389
I will... Yes.

670
00:53:52,555 --> 00:53:54,140
You promised me. Remember that.

671
00:53:54,307 --> 00:53:55,308
I will... I promise.

672
00:53:55,475 --> 00:53:56,351
There's a reason...

673
00:53:56,518 --> 00:53:59,104
a reason that Archimedes broke it in two.

674
00:53:59,312 --> 00:54:00,939
I know, Baz.

675
00:54:01,147 --> 00:54:01,982
Indy.

676
00:54:03,984 --> 00:54:05,360
Thanks, Wombat.

677
00:54:05,527 --> 00:54:07,487
He's gonna be all right in a few days.

678
00:54:09,572 --> 00:54:10,949
I'll call you as soon as I land.

679
00:54:16,037 --> 00:54:17,289
Ladies and gentlemen...

680
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:19,916
we are 20 minutes from landing in Tangier.

681
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,035
-Stop drinking!
-What are you doing?

682
00:54:55,201 --> 00:54:56,828
No more champagne! How many more...

683
00:54:56,953 --> 00:54:57,871
I'm staying.

684
00:54:57,996 --> 00:54:59,539
Go home. Go home!

685
00:55:16,181 --> 00:55:18,558
Miss Shaw, she's here.

686
00:55:22,854 --> 00:55:23,688
Forged in bronze.

687
00:55:24,022 --> 00:55:25,065
Nearly complete.

688
00:55:25,232 --> 00:55:26,900
It is an astrological clock.

689
00:55:27,484 --> 00:55:29,736
Dating third century BC...

690
00:55:29,903 --> 00:55:33,782
and built by Archimedes himself.

691
00:55:35,825 --> 00:55:37,244
All right, let's start at 20,000.

692
00:55:37,452 --> 00:55:38,536
20,000, thank you very much.

693
00:55:38,662 --> 00:55:39,955
30. 30.

694
00:55:40,163 --> 00:55:41,039
Gauges green...

695
00:55:41,665 --> 00:55:42,832
power full...

696
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:45,293
and when I reach 85, I rotate.

697
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,836
What next?

698
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,005
-Louis, help him! He's so cute.
-Pull back on the yoke.

699
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:51,424
-I did, man. I'm airborne.
-Yeah, he's airborne.

700
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:52,842
-Can I have a sip?
-Do I pick up the flaps?

701
00:55:52,968 --> 00:55:54,970
Don't touch the flaps under 400 feet.

702
00:55:55,136 --> 00:55:56,846
Decrease your pitch to get to 120.

703
00:55:56,972 --> 00:55:57,973
All right.

704
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,811
-Private auction, old timer.
-I've gotta get in there.

705
00:56:02,936 --> 00:56:05,522
No password, no entry.
I don't make the rules.

706
00:56:08,316 --> 00:56:10,026
-And what is the current bid?
-The bid is 50,000.

707
00:56:10,193 --> 00:56:11,528
Then I bid 55.

708
00:56:12,487 --> 00:56:13,446
-Who'll give me 60?
-60.

709
00:56:13,655 --> 00:56:15,073
60. 65?

710
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,449
-65. 70?
-75.

711
00:56:16,658 --> 00:56:17,909
-75. 80?
-80.

712
00:56:18,034 --> 00:56:19,661
-85.
-How about 90?

713
00:56:26,668 --> 00:56:27,544
This auction is private.

714
00:56:27,836 --> 00:56:28,920
This auction's over.

715
00:56:29,337 --> 00:56:30,672
Au contraire, it's hardly begun.

716
00:56:30,797 --> 00:56:32,174
-100.
-100,000.

717
00:56:32,382 --> 00:56:33,925
I like the hat, by the way.

718
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:35,302
Makes you look at least two years younger.

719
00:56:35,552 --> 00:56:36,636
Thanks.

720
00:56:36,803 --> 00:56:38,305
-110, bravo.
-I told you that this auction is over.

721
00:56:38,555 --> 00:56:39,848
Excuse me, who is this man?

722
00:56:39,973 --> 00:56:41,308
-I'm her godfather.
-He's mildly related.

723
00:56:41,516 --> 00:56:43,435
And she's up past her bedtime.

724
00:56:43,602 --> 00:56:44,853
-Come on, Wombat.
-I wouldn't do that.

725
00:56:44,978 --> 00:56:46,479
You want to explain it to the cops
at the bar?

726
00:56:46,646 --> 00:56:47,981
The ones I paid off?

727
00:56:48,523 --> 00:56:50,108
You're out of your depth, Jonesy.

728
00:56:50,275 --> 00:56:51,610
-"Jonesy"?
-He thinks I'm a criminal.

729
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:53,570
He's the one wanted for murder.

730
00:56:53,695 --> 00:56:55,739
Nice big picture in the New York Herald. 130?

731
00:56:55,906 --> 00:56:57,574
I didn't kill anyone.

732
00:56:57,741 --> 00:56:59,534
-No entry, it's a private auction.
-And you know it, Helena.

733
00:57:00,327 --> 00:57:03,580
But whoever did was looking for this.

734
00:57:04,164 --> 00:57:06,082
What you've got here is Pandora's Box.

735
00:57:07,292 --> 00:57:08,543
No, actually.

736
00:57:09,377 --> 00:57:10,921
It's my box.

737
00:57:13,507 --> 00:57:14,508
You.

738
00:57:16,218 --> 00:57:17,344
Have we met?

739
00:57:17,677 --> 00:57:18,553
No.

740
00:57:18,678 --> 00:57:20,013
My memory is a little fuzzy...

741
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,932
but your face rings a bell.

742
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:23,642
Are you still a Nazi?

743
00:57:27,729 --> 00:57:29,898
You're confused. My name is Schmidt.

744
00:57:30,398 --> 00:57:32,609
Professor Schmidt of Alabama University.

745
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,237
Professor Schmidt.

746
00:57:35,695 --> 00:57:36,655
How nice to meet you in person.

747
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:39,407
-150.
-After our conversation, Miss Shaw...

748
00:57:39,574 --> 00:57:41,576
I thought we'd come to an agreement
about the Dial.

749
00:57:41,701 --> 00:57:43,912
Funny. The last time I saw the other guy
who looks like you...

750
00:57:44,037 --> 00:57:45,831
he was also after this.

751
00:57:46,414 --> 00:57:47,999
Your numbers were light, Professor Schmidt.

752
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:49,251
But good news is, you're here now.

753
00:57:49,459 --> 00:57:51,962
-The bid is 160.
-You don't seem to understand, Miss Shaw.

754
00:57:52,045 --> 00:57:53,296
This relic is my property.

755
00:57:53,505 --> 00:57:55,048
It's not yours. You stole it.

756
00:57:55,173 --> 00:57:55,966
Then you stole it.

757
00:57:56,091 --> 00:57:57,676
And then I stole it.
It's called capitalism.

758
00:57:57,884 --> 00:57:58,718
The bid is 160.

759
00:57:58,927 --> 00:57:59,761
-160.
-170?

760
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:00,929
You should've stayed in New York.

761
00:58:01,054 --> 00:58:02,931
-170?
-You should've stayed out of Poland.

762
00:58:03,098 --> 00:58:04,933
170. Anyone? Anyone?

763
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,393
Going, going...

764
00:58:06,935 --> 00:58:07,769
Gone!

765
00:58:08,395 --> 00:58:09,396
Stay away!

766
00:58:11,106 --> 00:58:12,107
Get the Dial.

767
00:58:17,028 --> 00:58:17,863
Stay away!

768
00:58:27,122 --> 00:58:28,081
Oh, hello, Claude.

769
00:58:28,206 --> 00:58:29,583
You should not have come back, Helena.

770
00:58:38,717 --> 00:58:40,010
Get back.

771
00:58:50,854 --> 00:58:51,688
Teddy!

772
00:59:06,078 --> 00:59:07,162
Rahim says you stay.

773
00:59:19,174 --> 00:59:20,008
Thank you.

774
00:59:33,146 --> 00:59:34,523
See you in the past, Dr. Jones.

775
00:59:42,572 --> 00:59:44,324
Move! Get out of the way!

776
01:00:01,633 --> 01:00:02,634
It's my cab!

777
01:00:08,181 --> 01:00:09,349
Tell them to back off.

778
01:00:09,516 --> 01:00:10,892
I just told them to shoot you.

779
01:00:12,978 --> 01:00:14,146
All right, guys.

780
01:00:15,564 --> 01:00:16,982
Put the guns down.

781
01:00:17,107 --> 01:00:18,275
Put 'em down.

782
01:00:20,402 --> 01:00:21,236
All right.

783
01:00:22,988 --> 01:00:24,281
That's better.

784
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,745
Oh, dear.

785
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:40,964
Rahim.

786
01:00:42,007 --> 01:00:43,467
You're in pajamas.

787
01:00:44,051 --> 01:00:45,761
I was sleeping, Helena.

788
01:00:46,178 --> 01:00:47,137
Peacefully.

789
01:00:48,055 --> 01:00:49,890
Then my father woke me.

790
01:00:50,057 --> 01:00:52,601
He told me you'd returned to our hotel.

791
01:00:54,186 --> 01:00:56,396
Then he handed me this scimitar...

792
01:00:56,563 --> 01:00:59,399
and told me to come home with your head.

793
01:01:01,193 --> 01:01:02,527
Does it have to be that bit?

794
01:01:10,243 --> 01:01:13,121
I thought maybe you returned
because you loved me.

795
01:01:13,246 --> 01:01:14,331
Rahim...

796
01:01:15,165 --> 01:01:16,708
I had an item to sell.

797
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:18,752
Excuse me. The item she's talking about...

798
01:01:18,919 --> 01:01:20,545
-actually belongs to me.
-No. You do not need to...

799
01:01:20,712 --> 01:01:21,797
-And some very bad people...
-...intrude in this conversation.

800
01:01:21,963 --> 01:01:24,091
-...worse people, have run off with it.
-You do not need to get involved...

801
01:01:24,257 --> 01:01:25,175
-with my business.
-Is this your new man?

802
01:01:25,342 --> 01:01:26,635
-No. No, no.
-It's complicated.

803
01:01:28,345 --> 01:01:29,930
What exactly do you owe this guy?

804
01:01:30,055 --> 01:01:32,140
Just some bail money
and a lifetime of happiness.

805
01:01:32,265 --> 01:01:34,017
I presume you sold the ring.

806
01:01:34,142 --> 01:01:35,435
It didn't go for as much
as I thought it would.

807
01:01:35,978 --> 01:01:37,020
I'll do it!

808
01:01:37,187 --> 01:01:38,230
What are you... Hey!

809
01:01:44,486 --> 01:01:45,988
You just got me killed!

810
01:01:46,196 --> 01:01:48,740
Well, I'm not the one that's engaged
to a mobster!

811
01:01:48,907 --> 01:01:51,868
I don't need morality lessons
from an aging grave robber!

812
01:01:51,994 --> 01:01:53,203
I'm not a grave robber.

813
01:01:53,328 --> 01:01:55,664
Your father and I
did important work together.

814
01:01:58,083 --> 01:02:00,252
Don't tell me all your escapades were noble,
selfless quests.

815
01:02:00,419 --> 01:02:01,295
You did it for the buzz!

816
01:02:04,089 --> 01:02:05,132
Oh, good work, Teddy!

817
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:08,302
-Move over, kid.
-Hey!

818
01:02:18,979 --> 01:02:20,897
-Helena!
-Back up! Back up!

819
01:02:38,582 --> 01:02:39,458
Not this way!

820
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:40,917
You don't know where you're going, Indy!

821
01:02:41,084 --> 01:02:42,961
-Listen to him. He knows this town!
-I know Tangier!

822
01:02:47,382 --> 01:02:48,425
There he is!

823
01:02:53,555 --> 01:02:55,682
Faster. Go faster!

824
01:02:55,891 --> 01:02:57,851
Ten minutes to the airport, boss.

825
01:02:59,811 --> 01:03:02,522
I'm not sure Professor Schmidt
is an actual professor, by the way.

826
01:03:02,689 --> 01:03:03,815
-He's a Nazi!
-Turn left!

827
01:03:03,982 --> 01:03:05,525
Turn left! Turn left!

828
01:03:05,692 --> 01:03:06,777
-Oh, no!
-No!

829
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:23,418
Helena! Don't do this!

830
01:03:31,343 --> 01:03:32,970
-Hey, this way!
-That way!

831
01:03:33,929 --> 01:03:34,721
No!

832
01:03:35,889 --> 01:03:37,349
Helena!

833
01:03:39,351 --> 01:03:40,352
No!

834
01:03:50,112 --> 01:03:51,655
What the hell?

835
01:03:58,287 --> 01:03:59,496
Helena!

836
01:04:01,456 --> 01:04:02,332
Hey!

837
01:04:02,457 --> 01:04:03,375
Hey!

838
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:05,002
What the hell?

839
01:04:08,297 --> 01:04:09,339
Come on!

840
01:04:13,093 --> 01:04:14,928
Come on. Come on!

841
01:04:48,795 --> 01:04:51,423
You think he'd be proud of this?

842
01:04:51,548 --> 01:04:52,466
Who?

843
01:04:54,301 --> 01:04:55,135
Your father!

844
01:04:55,302 --> 01:04:58,222
His only daughter selling her soul
for bail money!

845
01:04:58,388 --> 01:04:59,681
Sounds quite cool when you put it like that.

846
01:04:59,848 --> 01:05:01,517
And it's not all bail money.

847
01:05:01,642 --> 01:05:03,977
-Some of it's gambling debt and some...
-Thank you, Teddy.

848
01:05:04,144 --> 01:05:05,812
Helena!
No!

849
01:05:06,021 --> 01:05:07,022
Helena!

850
01:05:08,732 --> 01:05:10,609
How did you end up like this?

851
01:05:10,776 --> 01:05:12,110
Well, you mean resourceful?

852
01:05:12,277 --> 01:05:14,571
Daring? Beautiful? Self-sufficient?

853
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:40,764
Hold on!

854
01:05:44,476 --> 01:05:45,477
Go this way!

855
01:05:55,028 --> 01:05:55,863
There he is.

856
01:06:08,542 --> 01:06:10,919
-Stop! Stop!
-Hey! Hey!

857
01:06:23,682 --> 01:06:24,850
On the left!

858
01:06:25,976 --> 01:06:26,977
Take the wheel, Teddy!

859
01:06:29,229 --> 01:06:30,272
What are you doing?

860
01:06:30,397 --> 01:06:31,940
Getting what's mine.

861
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:33,859
Helena!

862
01:06:38,155 --> 01:06:39,656
Damn it! You crazy?

863
01:06:42,326 --> 01:06:44,203
Hey! Helena!

864
01:06:48,165 --> 01:06:49,792
-Take the gun!
-Miss Shaw.

865
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:52,878
Let go, Miss Shaw!

866
01:07:15,734 --> 01:07:16,610
Let go.

867
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:19,238
Come on! Give me the Dial!

868
01:07:20,656 --> 01:07:21,990
Helena!

869
01:07:23,867 --> 01:07:24,785
Damn.

870
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:33,710
-Turn back! They went that way!
-He's gone!

871
01:07:33,877 --> 01:07:35,712
-Move over!
-Hey!

872
01:07:39,133 --> 01:07:42,219
I didn't come here to rescue you
from your fiancé!

873
01:07:42,344 --> 01:07:43,220
Rescue me?

874
01:07:48,392 --> 01:07:49,935
I just want the Dial back.

875
01:08:09,413 --> 01:08:10,914
Put your hands above your head.

876
01:08:12,207 --> 01:08:13,625
Not the smoothest break-up I ever had.

877
01:08:13,751 --> 01:08:15,961
-If your father was still alive...
-Well, he's not, Indy.

878
01:08:16,211 --> 01:08:17,629
Hey, something's wrong with the engine.

879
01:08:17,713 --> 01:08:19,757
If only there'd been someone there for me,
some father figure...

880
01:08:19,882 --> 01:08:22,760
someone specifically anointed for the job.

881
01:08:22,885 --> 01:08:25,179
-You have no idea about the kind...
-Don't beat yourself up about it.

882
01:08:25,345 --> 01:08:27,431
I mean, what even is a godfather?

883
01:08:28,432 --> 01:08:30,476
Anyway, family never was your strong suit.

884
01:08:31,185 --> 01:08:33,479
-What is the time, by the way?
-It's...

885
01:08:33,645 --> 01:08:34,646
Hey, no fair.

886
01:08:35,397 --> 01:08:36,356
Give me that back.

887
01:08:36,482 --> 01:08:37,649
That was my father's watch!

888
01:08:40,277 --> 01:08:41,070
Give it back to him.

889
01:08:45,616 --> 01:08:46,950
You're gonna have to leave town with me.

890
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:48,702
Rahim will be looking for you too.

891
01:08:48,827 --> 01:08:49,995
They'll go to Tangier airport first...

892
01:08:50,204 --> 01:08:52,373
so we'll need to catch a train
and get a plane from Casablanca.

893
01:08:54,541 --> 01:08:55,459
What was that?

894
01:09:00,672 --> 01:09:01,548
Damn.

895
01:09:03,926 --> 01:09:05,010
Yeah.

896
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,053
I know, sir.

897
01:09:08,514 --> 01:09:09,390
Yes...

898
01:09:10,724 --> 01:09:11,725
Copy.

899
01:09:16,814 --> 01:09:17,940
They pulled the plug.

900
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:19,566
You got them scared.

901
01:09:19,942 --> 01:09:21,610
-Because they don't understand.
-No.

902
01:09:21,735 --> 01:09:24,238
Because your associates killed
three American civilians...

903
01:09:24,405 --> 01:09:26,615
and blew up a nationally televised parade.

904
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:29,702
Because you stood up
the President of the United States...

905
01:09:29,868 --> 01:09:31,036
ran to Morocco...

906
01:09:31,286 --> 01:09:33,664
and created an incident
that required military extraction!

907
01:09:35,749 --> 01:09:37,501
Then take me to DC,
and I will explain it all.

908
01:09:37,668 --> 01:09:38,961
They want you to vanish.

909
01:09:39,086 --> 01:09:41,255
We have half the Dial now.

910
01:09:41,422 --> 01:09:42,756
They were just trying to keep you happy...

911
01:09:43,757 --> 01:09:45,426
letting you chase that thing.

912
01:09:45,592 --> 01:09:46,760
They never cared about it.

913
01:09:46,969 --> 01:09:49,513
They will, Miss Mason,
when they understand what it can do.

914
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,764
You put them on the moon.

915
01:09:51,515 --> 01:09:52,725
They got what they wanted.

916
01:09:54,018 --> 01:09:55,936
All right, buckle up. We're landing in Spain.

917
01:09:56,645 --> 01:09:58,647
C-9 transport will take you
from there to Maxwell.

918
01:09:58,772 --> 01:10:00,232
I'm not going back to Alabama!

919
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:02,693
All we need is a vessel to take us
to the Mediterranean.

920
01:10:03,319 --> 01:10:04,737
The Grafikos will take us to the other...

921
01:10:04,862 --> 01:10:06,905
Please, Miss Mason. Please.

922
01:10:07,072 --> 01:10:08,115
Let go of me, Schmidt.

923
01:10:08,282 --> 01:10:09,908
I'm asking you personally.

924
01:10:10,826 --> 01:10:12,286
You're a piece of work, Doc.

925
01:10:13,954 --> 01:10:14,747
Hey!

926
01:10:42,775 --> 01:10:44,360
Schmidt...

927
01:10:45,235 --> 01:10:46,820
My name is Voller.

928
01:10:49,698 --> 01:10:50,991
Jürgen Voller.

929
01:11:04,338 --> 01:11:06,090
That's a Sea Stallion.

930
01:11:06,256 --> 01:11:07,675
American helicopter.

931
01:11:08,676 --> 01:11:10,427
Did you know the Wright Brothers?

932
01:11:10,803 --> 01:11:12,346
-What?
-The Wright Brothers.

933
01:11:12,513 --> 01:11:13,597
Orville and Wilbur.

934
01:11:13,764 --> 01:11:15,975
They invented the airplane,
and they lived in Indiana.

935
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,726
Wilbur was born in Indiana.

936
01:11:17,851 --> 01:11:20,229
I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.

937
01:11:20,437 --> 01:11:22,982
And the Wright Brothers were born
during the Civil War.

938
01:11:23,148 --> 01:11:25,276
Oh, I thought maybe you went to school
with them.

939
01:11:26,694 --> 01:11:29,154
Oh, come on, Indy. That was funny.

940
01:11:29,363 --> 01:11:30,155
"Funny"?

941
01:11:31,282 --> 01:11:34,952
I'm stuck in Tangier with a broken tuk-tuk
and two thieves.

942
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:36,370
I'm wanted for murder.

943
01:11:36,537 --> 01:11:38,497
Nazis have half of Archimedes' Dial...

944
01:11:38,664 --> 01:11:39,999
and your father's notebooks.

945
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:42,418
I have a copy.

946
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:44,712
Dad's notebooks. I made a copy.

947
01:11:44,878 --> 01:11:45,754
Where?

948
01:11:46,839 --> 01:11:48,757
You memorized five notebooks?

949
01:11:48,924 --> 01:11:50,134
Seven. And of course not.

950
01:11:50,301 --> 01:11:51,885
Half of them were as dull as ditchwater.

951
01:11:52,803 --> 01:11:55,222
Just the really important bits.

952
01:11:56,223 --> 01:11:57,057
Like what?

953
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,726
The location of the Grafikos.

954
01:11:58,851 --> 01:12:00,603
Nobody knows where the Grafikos is.

955
01:12:00,769 --> 01:12:02,021
-Dad did.
-No, he didn't.

956
01:12:02,187 --> 01:12:03,439
-Yes, he did.
-No, he didn't.

957
01:12:03,606 --> 01:12:05,149
-Yes, he did.
-What's a Grafikos?

958
01:12:05,357 --> 01:12:06,692
It's directions to the rest of the Dial.

959
01:12:06,859 --> 01:12:08,402
Ask her if she knows what language it's in.

960
01:12:08,569 --> 01:12:10,404
It isn't in a language. It's in a code.

961
01:12:10,571 --> 01:12:11,822
What code?

962
01:12:11,947 --> 01:12:13,407
Archimedes used two codes.

963
01:12:13,574 --> 01:12:15,117
Linear B and Polybius Square.

964
01:12:15,284 --> 01:12:18,662
So, even if you find the Grafikos,
without me, you can't read it.

965
01:12:19,163 --> 01:12:20,497
Please.

966
01:12:20,623 --> 01:12:22,499
Dad taught me Polybius when I was nine.

967
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:24,168
Used to leave little notes around the house.

968
01:12:24,418 --> 01:12:25,252
"Tidy your room."

969
01:12:25,502 --> 01:12:26,795
"Stay away from my brandy."

970
01:12:27,922 --> 01:12:28,923
What if it's Linear B?

971
01:12:29,924 --> 01:12:31,217
50 quid it's Polybius.

972
01:12:32,259 --> 01:12:33,427
Give me that.

973
01:12:33,594 --> 01:12:34,511
Hey.

974
01:12:34,929 --> 01:12:36,138
That won't work.

975
01:12:36,263 --> 01:12:38,557
Moroccan chewing gum's made from the sap
of the Manilkara.

976
01:12:38,724 --> 01:12:40,017
Heat resistant.

977
01:12:41,518 --> 01:12:42,728
Try and start it.

978
01:12:47,691 --> 01:12:48,817
-Start it.
-I am.

979
01:12:50,903 --> 01:12:52,530
Huh? Huh?

980
01:12:53,155 --> 01:12:54,823
-Huh?
-It won't hold.

981
01:12:54,949 --> 01:12:56,909
It'll get us to the train station.

982
01:12:57,034 --> 01:12:58,160
"Us"?

983
01:12:58,285 --> 01:12:59,537
-You goin' home?
-No.

984
01:12:59,745 --> 01:13:01,497
I'm going to Casablanca.

985
01:13:01,664 --> 01:13:03,457
Then I'm gonna hop a plane to the Aegean.

986
01:13:03,624 --> 01:13:04,500
Just like you.

987
01:13:04,959 --> 01:13:06,502
What makes you think
we're going to the Aegean?

988
01:13:06,627 --> 01:13:09,713
You gotta get to the Grafikos
before the Nazis.

989
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,924
Archimedes was surrounded by Romans.

990
01:13:12,716 --> 01:13:13,884
Where else would it be?

991
01:13:14,009 --> 01:13:15,010
The Aegean is huge, Indy.

992
01:13:15,177 --> 01:13:16,303
And you don't have coordinates.

993
01:13:16,554 --> 01:13:18,013
And you don't have a boat.

994
01:13:20,975 --> 01:13:23,352
I've got an old friend in Greece.

995
01:13:23,561 --> 01:13:24,979
An expert diver.

996
01:13:25,104 --> 01:13:26,981
With a big, beautiful boat...

997
01:13:27,106 --> 01:13:29,149
that'll get us there before they will.

998
01:13:30,025 --> 01:13:32,069
You need me...

999
01:13:32,236 --> 01:13:33,487
and you know it.

1000
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:24,788
Renny!

1001
01:14:26,874 --> 01:14:27,791
Indy?

1002
01:14:28,793 --> 01:14:29,835
Indy!

1003
01:14:35,216 --> 01:14:37,176
So, that's the expert diver?

1004
01:14:37,343 --> 01:14:39,595
Spain's greatest frogman.

1005
01:14:42,556 --> 01:14:43,390
Hey!

1006
01:14:43,557 --> 01:14:46,977
So, Spain's greatest frogman has a shit boat
and only one good frog leg?

1007
01:14:47,186 --> 01:14:48,229
Stop it.

1008
01:14:52,066 --> 01:14:53,359
You got a different boat.

1009
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,318
Stop it.

1010
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:09,834
We're going here.

1011
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,921
Where they found the first part
of the Antikythera.

1012
01:15:14,839 --> 01:15:15,798
But...

1013
01:15:17,341 --> 01:15:18,676
we're going deeper.

1014
01:15:20,177 --> 01:15:23,973
Dad tracked down the old sponge diver
who found the Dial.

1015
01:15:24,098 --> 01:15:25,224
He told him...

1016
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:28,352
that the wrecked Roman ship broke up
under the sea...

1017
01:15:28,561 --> 01:15:29,687
70 feet below.

1018
01:15:29,895 --> 01:15:32,815
Filled with the skeletons
of over 100 centurions.

1019
01:15:34,024 --> 01:15:35,151
That's where they found it.

1020
01:15:36,777 --> 01:15:39,822
But he said that most of the ship
had broken off...

1021
01:15:39,989 --> 01:15:41,782
and sunk to the ocean floor.

1022
01:15:42,741 --> 01:15:44,243
Too deep for sponge divers.

1023
01:15:45,286 --> 01:15:48,122
So, Dad started wondering
why a Roman warship...

1024
01:15:48,289 --> 01:15:51,751
would sail out of Syracuse
with 100 centurions on board.

1025
01:15:55,379 --> 01:15:58,799
They weren't taking half a Dial
for a joyride.

1026
01:16:02,678 --> 01:16:04,180
They had the Grafikos...

1027
01:16:07,057 --> 01:16:09,226
and they were looking
for the rest of the Dial.

1028
01:16:12,605 --> 01:16:14,148
Your dad was a genius.

1029
01:16:14,857 --> 01:16:15,775
Yeah.

1030
01:16:17,276 --> 01:16:18,235
He was.

1031
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:39,173
Seven of spades.

1032
01:16:42,426 --> 01:16:43,511
How do you do that?

1033
01:16:43,719 --> 01:16:44,762
Wow.

1034
01:16:45,596 --> 01:16:46,430
Do it again.

1035
01:16:50,434 --> 01:16:52,311
Pick a card, Dr. Jones.

1036
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:00,986
Seven of spades!

1037
01:17:03,114 --> 01:17:04,156
She's magic.

1038
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,408
Trick deck.

1039
01:17:05,616 --> 01:17:06,534
No.

1040
01:17:07,785 --> 01:17:09,203
I force the card.

1041
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:10,663
I offer the mark...

1042
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,039
you...

1043
01:17:12,164 --> 01:17:13,165
the feeling of a choice...

1044
01:17:13,332 --> 01:17:15,543
but ultimately,
I make you pick the card I want.

1045
01:17:17,712 --> 01:17:18,838
"The mark."

1046
01:17:21,924 --> 01:17:23,843
Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.

1047
01:17:24,009 --> 01:17:25,803
I have to check the lines.

1048
01:17:31,767 --> 01:17:32,893
Good night.

1049
01:17:36,022 --> 01:17:39,150
You remember seeing any dates
in your father's notebooks?

1050
01:17:40,443 --> 01:17:41,819
Dates?

1051
01:17:41,986 --> 01:17:43,237
What dates?

1052
01:17:44,155 --> 01:17:45,156
These dates.

1053
01:17:48,951 --> 01:17:51,329
Written over and over again in this letter.

1054
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:54,582
August 20th, 1969.

1055
01:17:54,832 --> 01:17:56,334
That's three days from now.

1056
01:17:56,459 --> 01:17:58,753
And the same date in 1939.

1057
01:17:58,961 --> 01:18:01,339
Two weeks before Hitler invades Poland.

1058
01:18:03,799 --> 01:18:04,759
Wait.

1059
01:18:05,551 --> 01:18:07,887
Now you believe the Dial has magical powers?

1060
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:11,182
I don't believe in magic, Wombat.

1061
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,436
But a few times in my life, I've seen things.

1062
01:18:18,564 --> 01:18:20,316
Things I can't explain.

1063
01:18:21,692 --> 01:18:24,111
And I've come to believe it's not so much...

1064
01:18:24,236 --> 01:18:26,364
what you believe.

1065
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:28,783
It's how hard you believe it.

1066
01:18:31,911 --> 01:18:33,204
I've seen things too, Indy.

1067
01:18:34,163 --> 01:18:36,749
The only thing worth believing in, ever...

1068
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:38,501
is cash.

1069
01:18:40,878 --> 01:18:41,963
Right.

1070
01:18:47,718 --> 01:18:48,844
What if you could go back in time?

1071
01:18:51,222 --> 01:18:52,264
What would you do?

1072
01:18:53,599 --> 01:18:55,017
Witness the Trojan War?

1073
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:57,645
Check in on Cleopatra?

1074
01:19:01,232 --> 01:19:03,359
I'd stop my son from enlisting.

1075
01:19:06,529 --> 01:19:08,281
Did he sign up to please you?

1076
01:19:09,323 --> 01:19:11,534
No, he signed up to piss me off.

1077
01:19:15,288 --> 01:19:17,456
How would you have stopped him?

1078
01:19:21,627 --> 01:19:23,462
I'd tell him he was gonna die.

1079
01:19:30,469 --> 01:19:32,346
I'd tell him that his mother would...

1080
01:19:35,057 --> 01:19:36,851
find no end to her grief.

1081
01:19:38,644 --> 01:19:40,438
And that his father would be...

1082
01:19:43,316 --> 01:19:45,192
helpless to console her.

1083
01:19:48,487 --> 01:19:51,032
And that the loss would put an end
to their marriage.

1084
01:20:05,004 --> 01:20:06,255
You're still wearing the ring.

1085
01:20:29,612 --> 01:20:30,571
Promising.

1086
01:20:39,038 --> 01:20:40,414
More promising.

1087
01:20:46,295 --> 01:20:47,338
Hello.

1088
01:20:49,507 --> 01:20:51,509
Get your gear on. They're waiting.

1089
01:20:56,222 --> 01:20:57,014
Hey.

1090
01:20:58,307 --> 01:20:59,267
Come here.

1091
01:21:00,101 --> 01:21:01,519
Okay.

1092
01:21:01,686 --> 01:21:02,478
I'm gonna show you something.

1093
01:21:02,645 --> 01:21:04,564
Gosh, this looks important.

1094
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:08,651
Around the rope...

1095
01:21:08,901 --> 01:21:11,070
Now, we are going deep.

1096
01:21:11,237 --> 01:21:14,073
Descend fast,
and breathe through these hoses.

1097
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,074
Okay?

1098
01:21:15,491 --> 01:21:17,076
Stay separate.

1099
01:21:17,243 --> 01:21:19,203
No crisscross. All right?

1100
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:20,496
We cannot stay long.

1101
01:21:20,663 --> 01:21:24,000
I have a method
that usually prevents the bends.

1102
01:21:25,001 --> 01:21:26,043
-Usually?
-Yeah.

1103
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:27,378
I call it "the bounce."

1104
01:21:27,587 --> 01:21:28,588
You know, fast down...

1105
01:21:28,754 --> 01:21:30,673
three minutes on the bottom, and then up.

1106
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:31,924
Three minutes!

1107
01:21:32,091 --> 01:21:33,926
No one more second.

1108
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,386
Three minutes.

1109
01:21:35,928 --> 01:21:36,762
Yeah, that's right.

1110
01:21:37,013 --> 01:21:38,764
-Where is my lighter?
-I don't know, capitán.

1111
01:21:40,057 --> 01:21:40,975
We have to go.

1112
01:21:43,769 --> 01:21:44,729
Quick question.

1113
01:21:44,937 --> 01:21:46,314
What's that?

1114
01:21:46,439 --> 01:21:47,732
-They're sharks?
-No.

1115
01:21:47,899 --> 01:21:50,276
No, no. No sharks here. Eels.

1116
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,278
Eels?

1117
01:21:52,403 --> 01:21:53,654
Anguilas.

1118
01:21:53,821 --> 01:21:54,739
Most are small.

1119
01:21:54,947 --> 01:21:56,449
Sometimes they are big. Two meters.

1120
01:21:56,616 --> 01:21:58,659
But if you see them, stay still.

1121
01:21:58,868 --> 01:22:02,121
They bite you, they lock the jaw. Yeah.

1122
01:22:02,288 --> 01:22:03,623
They look like snakes.

1123
01:22:04,499 --> 01:22:05,458
No, they don't.

1124
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:07,627
Private Brandy reporting for duty.

1125
01:22:08,294 --> 01:22:09,128
You're not coming, Teddy?

1126
01:22:09,837 --> 01:22:11,005
I can't swim.

1127
01:22:11,172 --> 01:22:12,340
Lucky him.

1128
01:22:12,465 --> 01:22:13,758
Everyone can swim.

1129
01:22:15,635 --> 01:22:17,595
Reach and pull. Reach and pull.

1130
01:22:19,639 --> 01:22:21,891
All right. You stay here with Hector
and watch our lines.

1131
01:22:25,686 --> 01:22:26,979
It is time, camarada.

1132
01:24:15,421 --> 01:24:16,297
Two minutes?

1133
01:25:47,722 --> 01:25:48,639
I got it.

1134
01:26:29,597 --> 01:26:30,431
Hey.

1135
01:27:02,547 --> 01:27:03,381
Hurry up!

1136
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:19,981
Helena!

1137
01:27:28,865 --> 01:27:29,782
Come on.

1138
01:27:29,866 --> 01:27:31,492
That's it. That's it. That's it.

1139
01:27:32,285 --> 01:27:33,536
That's it.

1140
01:27:56,684 --> 01:27:57,894
Who are these people?

1141
01:28:00,355 --> 01:28:01,147
Nazis.

1142
01:28:01,356 --> 01:28:03,816
First, you return my Dial, Dr. Jones...

1143
01:28:03,983 --> 01:28:07,111
and now, you bring me the Grafikos.

1144
01:28:08,029 --> 01:28:10,198
I'm very happy you're not wasting
in retirement.

1145
01:28:10,573 --> 01:28:12,909
I should have retired you
when I had the chance.

1146
01:28:13,117 --> 01:28:14,243
Where are your sponsors?

1147
01:28:14,452 --> 01:28:15,954
I'm on my own now.

1148
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,830
Things move forward, Dr. Jones.

1149
01:28:17,997 --> 01:28:18,873
And sometimes...

1150
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:22,627
they go backward.

1151
01:28:25,838 --> 01:28:28,091
Now, let's get comfortable
and have a little talk.

1152
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:56,536
What language is that?

1153
01:28:56,703 --> 01:28:58,288
It's not a language.

1154
01:28:59,539 --> 01:29:00,623
It's a code.

1155
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:02,500
Polybius.

1156
01:29:03,293 --> 01:29:04,627
You owe me 50 quid.

1157
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,756
Not familiar with Polybius cipher?

1158
01:29:08,882 --> 01:29:09,841
No.

1159
01:29:10,675 --> 01:29:12,010
But it appears you are.

1160
01:29:16,431 --> 01:29:17,390
Read it, please.

1161
01:29:25,815 --> 01:29:26,774
No.

1162
01:29:32,572 --> 01:29:33,573
Indy...

1163
01:29:44,626 --> 01:29:45,919
Feeling helpful now?

1164
01:29:49,339 --> 01:29:50,173
I am.

1165
01:29:53,343 --> 01:29:54,636
I know this stuff backwards.

1166
01:29:54,761 --> 01:29:55,678
No!

1167
01:29:57,555 --> 01:29:58,473
Sorry, Indy.

1168
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:00,183
I don't do noble death.

1169
01:30:00,934 --> 01:30:01,976
Just...

1170
01:30:02,101 --> 01:30:03,561
cold, hard maths.

1171
01:30:04,103 --> 01:30:05,939
I crack the code,
help you find the other half.

1172
01:30:07,315 --> 01:30:09,025
One hundred grand. Cash.

1173
01:30:09,192 --> 01:30:10,151
Helena...

1174
01:30:10,818 --> 01:30:11,778
Take it or leave it.

1175
01:30:13,321 --> 01:30:14,364
You have a deal.

1176
01:30:27,961 --> 01:30:29,712
He'll never pay you.

1177
01:30:31,214 --> 01:30:34,092
I think you will find this is worth
more than your asking price.

1178
01:30:43,643 --> 01:30:45,061
-Teddy.
-Helena...

1179
01:30:45,228 --> 01:30:46,479
don't do this.

1180
01:30:51,901 --> 01:30:53,236
Let's see what we've got here.

1181
01:30:55,446 --> 01:30:56,865
"My Makhana..."

1182
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:58,324
that's "machine"...

1183
01:30:59,576 --> 01:31:03,121
"lies with me, in the city I left.

1184
01:31:03,288 --> 01:31:05,665
"Where wolves teach men to walk.

1185
01:31:05,832 --> 01:31:09,961
"Under one of nine, I lie."

1186
01:31:12,839 --> 01:31:14,549
Only one thing lies anywhere forever.

1187
01:31:14,716 --> 01:31:17,343
The dead. So, if the Dial lies with him,
then...

1188
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:20,805
then this is directions to his tomb.

1189
01:31:21,264 --> 01:31:22,599
The Tomb of Archimedes?

1190
01:31:24,017 --> 01:31:25,810
Undiscovered for two millennia.

1191
01:31:28,897 --> 01:31:30,982
"The city I left."

1192
01:31:31,649 --> 01:31:35,028
Archimedes lived two places his entire life,
so he only left one.

1193
01:31:35,945 --> 01:31:37,989
Anyone? At the back?

1194
01:31:38,865 --> 01:31:40,325
Come on, Indy. Everyone knows this.

1195
01:31:40,533 --> 01:31:41,326
Even this clown.

1196
01:31:41,534 --> 01:31:42,911
Alexandria.

1197
01:31:43,036 --> 01:31:44,078
Full marks.

1198
01:31:45,288 --> 01:31:47,499
Now, "wolf" in Greek is "lycos."

1199
01:31:47,665 --> 01:31:49,918
Root of the word "lycaeum" or "school."

1200
01:31:50,084 --> 01:31:52,712
And the Doric for "walking" is...

1201
01:31:54,088 --> 01:31:54,964
"peripatio."

1202
01:31:56,257 --> 01:31:59,010
Which also happens to be the word for...

1203
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,184
I thought you were a bright spark.

1204
01:32:08,853 --> 01:32:11,981
"Peripatio" means "walking"...

1205
01:32:12,107 --> 01:32:14,526
but it also means "counting."

1206
01:32:14,692 --> 01:32:17,821
So, "Where wolves teach men to walk"...

1207
01:32:18,613 --> 01:32:20,865
-could be...
-The School of Mathematics.

1208
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:23,827
Is correct.

1209
01:32:23,952 --> 01:32:25,495
Now, the next bit is easy.

1210
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:28,331
"Beneath one of nine"?

1211
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:30,917
There are nine Muses.

1212
01:32:31,084 --> 01:32:32,168
The Museon.

1213
01:32:32,293 --> 01:32:34,838
The Greek word
for the Great Library of Alexandria.

1214
01:32:35,004 --> 01:32:38,758
Which, as we all know, has nine statues
supporting its roof.

1215
01:32:38,925 --> 01:32:39,843
May I?

1216
01:32:41,094 --> 01:32:41,928
Thank you.

1217
01:32:43,388 --> 01:32:46,099
The nine Muses, in reverse order...

1218
01:32:47,642 --> 01:32:49,060
are Calliope...

1219
01:32:50,019 --> 01:32:50,895
Urania...

1220
01:32:52,397 --> 01:32:53,440
Polymnia...

1221
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:56,025
-Erato...
-Polymnia.

1222
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:58,570
...and Meli whasisname...

1223
01:32:59,112 --> 01:32:59,988
that other one...

1224
01:33:00,822 --> 01:33:01,698
Thalia...

1225
01:33:02,449 --> 01:33:03,658
Euteroe...

1226
01:33:03,825 --> 01:33:05,910
but the first is...

1227
01:33:06,327 --> 01:33:07,162
Clio.

1228
01:33:08,997 --> 01:33:10,123
The Muse of history and time.

1229
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:11,541
That Archimedes...

1230
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:12,876
-what a clever bugger.
-The entrance...

1231
01:33:13,042 --> 01:33:15,128
to the tomb
is by the School of Mathematics...

1232
01:33:15,295 --> 01:33:17,046
under a statue of Clio...

1233
01:33:17,172 --> 01:33:20,008
in the ruins
of the Great Library of Alexandria.

1234
01:33:20,133 --> 01:33:21,384
Gold star for Dr. Brains.

1235
01:33:23,011 --> 01:33:23,845
Teddy!

1236
01:33:33,855 --> 01:33:35,315
The Grafikos, get it!

1237
01:34:02,967 --> 01:34:05,720
I have said it before,
and I will say it again!

1238
01:34:05,887 --> 01:34:08,431
When you're in a tight spot, dynamite.

1239
01:34:10,225 --> 01:34:11,810
My friend was just murdered.

1240
01:34:17,273 --> 01:34:18,274
Sorry.

1241
01:34:18,441 --> 01:34:20,193
You told them everything.

1242
01:34:21,903 --> 01:34:22,987
Word for word.

1243
01:34:23,613 --> 01:34:25,532
But Archimedes didn't make it that easy.

1244
01:34:26,282 --> 01:34:28,201
The tomb isn't in Alexandria.

1245
01:34:37,293 --> 01:34:38,294
Go!

1246
01:34:41,798 --> 01:34:42,757
So, what do you see?

1247
01:34:43,425 --> 01:34:45,218
Polybius square.

1248
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,886
Made of?

1249
01:34:49,431 --> 01:34:50,640
Wax and wood.

1250
01:34:52,225 --> 01:34:53,518
Anything else?

1251
01:34:57,147 --> 01:34:58,023
It's heavy.

1252
01:35:01,067 --> 01:35:02,193
Too heavy.

1253
01:35:04,279 --> 01:35:05,405
Give me that.

1254
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:47,280
This is solid gold?

1255
01:35:47,447 --> 01:35:48,657
Ancient gold.

1256
01:35:50,241 --> 01:35:51,242
From the Nile.

1257
01:35:52,953 --> 01:35:53,870
Hold it, Teddy.

1258
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:06,424
Sell this thing...

1259
01:36:06,633 --> 01:36:08,259
and we are out of the hole and then some.

1260
01:36:08,426 --> 01:36:09,344
I have just the customer.

1261
01:36:09,511 --> 01:36:12,514
-Cranky, old Duchess in Gibraltar...
-This is going in a museum.

1262
01:36:15,892 --> 01:36:17,185
Take the wheel, Teddy.

1263
01:36:24,025 --> 01:36:25,026
What does it say?

1264
01:36:27,153 --> 01:36:30,031
"Search where Dionysius...

1265
01:36:30,865 --> 01:36:33,535
"hears each whisper...

1266
01:36:34,369 --> 01:36:36,413
"like a hurricane."

1267
01:36:39,332 --> 01:36:40,667
The Ear.

1268
01:36:41,418 --> 01:36:43,253
The cave of Dionysius.

1269
01:36:44,129 --> 01:36:45,088
Where is that?

1270
01:36:46,506 --> 01:36:47,549
In Sicily.

1271
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:51,136
-How much fuel have we got?
-It's full.

1272
01:37:00,186 --> 01:37:01,187
They're heading west.

1273
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,398
Not east.

1274
01:37:32,469 --> 01:37:33,386
I want the papaya.

1275
01:37:33,553 --> 01:37:34,596
How much is it?

1276
01:37:38,058 --> 01:37:38,934
Take this.

1277
01:37:41,811 --> 01:37:43,980
Look at that kid with the straw hat.

1278
01:37:45,148 --> 01:37:46,066
This way.

1279
01:37:49,236 --> 01:37:50,111
Hey.

1280
01:37:51,655 --> 01:37:52,948
What do you think?

1281
01:37:59,955 --> 01:38:01,248
What are we doing?

1282
01:38:02,791 --> 01:38:04,501
Waiting for closing time at the caves.

1283
01:38:04,668 --> 01:38:06,169
It's crawling with tourists.

1284
01:38:06,336 --> 01:38:08,755
Okay, so he's, like, running the show now?

1285
01:38:10,131 --> 01:38:11,508
He's not running the show, Teddy.

1286
01:38:12,968 --> 01:38:16,096
I just thought we were in this
for all the wrong reasons.

1287
01:38:16,596 --> 01:38:17,764
We are.

1288
01:38:21,351 --> 01:38:22,227
Most assuredly.

1289
01:38:22,394 --> 01:38:25,188
You know he's never gonna let us sell
any of that stuff.

1290
01:38:26,648 --> 01:38:28,358
I'm still in charge, Teddy.

1291
01:38:28,483 --> 01:38:30,485
Helena, get over here! Give me a hand!

1292
01:38:36,408 --> 01:38:37,492
You splurged.

1293
01:38:38,869 --> 01:38:39,828
Here's your backpack.

1294
01:38:40,036 --> 01:38:40,996
Where's the kid?

1295
01:38:54,968 --> 01:38:56,011
Hey, watch it!

1296
01:38:56,636 --> 01:38:57,888
What's wrong with you?

1297
01:39:26,416 --> 01:39:27,542
Hello.

1298
01:39:29,211 --> 01:39:30,045
Hey.

1299
01:39:33,173 --> 01:39:34,049
Let me go!

1300
01:39:35,342 --> 01:39:36,384
Let me go!

1301
01:39:44,142 --> 01:39:46,353
Get off me! Let me go!

1302
01:39:50,065 --> 01:39:50,899
Hey, hey, hey!

1303
01:40:02,077 --> 01:40:03,203
Helena!

1304
01:40:04,538 --> 01:40:05,997
They've got Teddy.

1305
01:40:08,083 --> 01:40:09,668
They took him up the hill somewhere.

1306
01:40:29,771 --> 01:40:30,814
What are they gonna do to him?

1307
01:40:31,022 --> 01:40:33,692
He knows about the Ear,
what the Grafikos says.

1308
01:40:35,068 --> 01:40:36,570
They're not gonna hurt him.

1309
01:40:36,695 --> 01:40:37,863
They're gonna use him...

1310
01:40:38,572 --> 01:40:40,866
to get the other half of the Dial.

1311
01:40:41,074 --> 01:40:42,409
We gotta get there first.

1312
01:40:55,172 --> 01:40:59,217
Colonizing queens built many cities
in Sicily.

1313
01:40:59,384 --> 01:41:00,886
-The temple...
-Let's go.

1314
01:41:01,595 --> 01:41:04,139
...is the oldest of the Greek temples.

1315
01:41:05,223 --> 01:41:06,558
The cave's over there.

1316
01:41:16,902 --> 01:41:18,695
Could we go a little faster, please?

1317
01:41:27,913 --> 01:41:29,372
The Ear of Dionysius.

1318
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:38,006
Wow.

1319
01:41:52,312 --> 01:41:55,816
"Search where Dionysius hears each whisper
like a hurricane."

1320
01:41:57,025 --> 01:41:58,026
That's some echo.

1321
01:41:59,736 --> 01:42:02,406
Keep making noise till we find out
where it's loudest.

1322
01:42:19,798 --> 01:42:20,632
Stop.

1323
01:42:28,598 --> 01:42:29,683
This is it.

1324
01:42:34,688 --> 01:42:35,689
Greek pediment.

1325
01:42:36,815 --> 01:42:37,816
An entrance.

1326
01:42:39,234 --> 01:42:40,235
Used to be.

1327
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:44,531
A crescent.

1328
01:42:47,409 --> 01:42:48,493
Just like on the Grafikos.

1329
01:42:56,043 --> 01:42:57,878
I think there's an opening up there.

1330
01:43:04,718 --> 01:43:05,552
You okay up there?

1331
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:07,554
Yes.

1332
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:11,433
You're not moving.

1333
01:43:13,894 --> 01:43:15,145
I'm thinking.

1334
01:43:18,065 --> 01:43:18,940
About?

1335
01:43:20,108 --> 01:43:23,028
About what the hell I'm doing up here,
40 feet in the air...

1336
01:43:23,445 --> 01:43:24,946
with crap shoulders...

1337
01:43:25,113 --> 01:43:26,948
crumbling vertebrae...

1338
01:43:27,074 --> 01:43:29,660
a plate in one leg, screws in the other.

1339
01:43:29,785 --> 01:43:31,036
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

1340
01:43:31,662 --> 01:43:32,788
No, you don't get it.

1341
01:43:33,622 --> 01:43:34,790
You're half my age.

1342
01:43:35,832 --> 01:43:38,543
You haven't been forced
to drink the blood of Kali.

1343
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:39,920
No. Fair enough.

1344
01:43:40,754 --> 01:43:42,589
Or been tortured with voodoo.

1345
01:43:43,882 --> 01:43:46,718
And I'm just guessing, but I don't think
you've been shot nine times...

1346
01:43:46,843 --> 01:43:49,304
including once by your father.

1347
01:43:51,014 --> 01:43:52,391
Dad shot you?

1348
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,267
Don't talk to me.

1349
01:43:54,434 --> 01:43:55,602
Just go ahead. I'll follow you.

1350
01:44:04,403 --> 01:44:05,278
No, no, no.

1351
01:44:05,445 --> 01:44:06,905
We are close. We are close.

1352
01:44:07,072 --> 01:44:08,073
Look around you.

1353
01:44:08,323 --> 01:44:09,783
-We are close.
-The Cave of Dionysius.

1354
01:44:09,908 --> 01:44:10,784
No, no, no.

1355
01:44:10,867 --> 01:44:12,828
The cave is closed for renovation.

1356
01:44:14,913 --> 01:44:15,872
Let me ask again.

1357
01:44:16,039 --> 01:44:17,958
Where is the Cave of Dionysius?

1358
01:44:37,644 --> 01:44:39,813
What's the matter? You worried about the kid?

1359
01:44:41,064 --> 01:44:42,774
Are you sure they won't hurt him?

1360
01:44:42,899 --> 01:44:44,109
He'll be fine.

1361
01:44:44,276 --> 01:44:45,319
He's smart.

1362
01:44:47,195 --> 01:44:48,572
Where'd you find him?

1363
01:44:50,324 --> 01:44:54,911
He tried to steal my purse outside a casino
in Marrakesh when he was 10.

1364
01:44:55,078 --> 01:44:56,913
I hit him repeatedly with my car door...

1365
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,666
but he didn't let go and neither did I.

1366
01:44:59,833 --> 01:45:01,335
So, been together ever since.

1367
01:45:02,502 --> 01:45:04,421
Thought you were all about the money.

1368
01:45:05,589 --> 01:45:06,548
I am.

1369
01:45:09,635 --> 01:45:13,680
Nobody memorizes every page
of their dead father's notebooks...

1370
01:45:13,805 --> 01:45:14,890
for the money.

1371
01:45:21,605 --> 01:45:22,606
Herr Voller!

1372
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:34,576
They went that way.

1373
01:45:44,878 --> 01:45:45,921
Why?

1374
01:45:49,883 --> 01:45:51,760
Come on, come on.

1375
01:45:54,471 --> 01:45:55,389
Let's go.

1376
01:46:00,227 --> 01:46:01,144
Oh, my...

1377
01:46:04,147 --> 01:46:05,649
Oh, my God!

1378
01:46:06,525 --> 01:46:07,818
Oh, my God!

1379
01:46:07,985 --> 01:46:09,444
-Oh, God!
-No, no.

1380
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:11,738
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1381
01:46:16,201 --> 01:46:17,244
Are they off me?

1382
01:46:17,452 --> 01:46:18,245
-Get 'em off!
-No, no.

1383
01:46:18,453 --> 01:46:19,663
-Get 'em off!
-Wait.

1384
01:46:32,676 --> 01:46:33,677
What is that?

1385
01:46:36,763 --> 01:46:37,806
Methane.

1386
01:46:39,224 --> 01:46:40,517
Don't breathe.

1387
01:46:40,684 --> 01:46:41,685
Don't breathe?

1388
01:46:45,314 --> 01:46:46,773
We've gotta get outta here.

1389
01:46:55,657 --> 01:46:56,617
Athena.

1390
01:46:58,327 --> 01:46:59,661
Goddess of war.

1391
01:47:02,539 --> 01:47:03,749
And reason.

1392
01:47:08,003 --> 01:47:09,338
"Under the moon...

1393
01:47:11,673 --> 01:47:13,675
"life lies at her feet."

1394
01:47:21,475 --> 01:47:22,768
Water displacement.

1395
01:47:23,602 --> 01:47:24,895
Get in the pool!

1396
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:27,022
Why? Help me open the door.

1397
01:47:27,189 --> 01:47:28,941
Well, they didn't get out the doors!

1398
01:47:29,024 --> 01:47:29,983
Get in the pool!

1399
01:47:30,984 --> 01:47:32,903
Okay, I'm getting in the pool.

1400
01:47:33,028 --> 01:47:34,154
Help me.

1401
01:47:36,907 --> 01:47:38,951
Archimedes was fascinated...

1402
01:47:40,410 --> 01:47:42,371
by water displacement!

1403
01:48:23,579 --> 01:48:24,788
Hey! Get back here!

1404
01:48:24,955 --> 01:48:25,706
Klaber!

1405
01:48:39,887 --> 01:48:41,013
You don't need to do that.

1406
01:49:07,206 --> 01:49:08,040
Hey!

1407
01:49:09,249 --> 01:49:10,084
Give me that!

1408
01:49:12,086 --> 01:49:12,961
No!

1409
01:49:20,344 --> 01:49:21,637
Leave them.

1410
01:49:22,346 --> 01:49:23,972
I said leave them.

1411
01:49:48,414 --> 01:49:49,957
Reach and pull.

1412
01:49:50,082 --> 01:49:51,750
Reach and pull.

1413
01:49:51,875 --> 01:49:54,044
Reach and pull.

1414
01:50:22,448 --> 01:50:24,074
Archimedes' tomb.

1415
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:54,271
Grab that corner.

1416
01:51:40,567 --> 01:51:41,485
Indy.

1417
01:51:43,946 --> 01:51:45,280
This frieze...

1418
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:49,243
It's a phoenix.

1419
01:51:49,368 --> 01:51:50,369
A common icon.

1420
01:51:50,536 --> 01:51:52,121
No. Look, it isn't.

1421
01:51:53,747 --> 01:51:55,416
This phoenix has propellers.

1422
01:52:04,258 --> 01:52:05,801
What's this doing here?

1423
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,563
Clocks won't be invented
for 1,000 years...

1424
01:52:18,230 --> 01:52:19,690
much less watches.

1425
01:52:22,234 --> 01:52:23,402
Archimedes used it.

1426
01:52:27,031 --> 01:52:28,324
Dad was right.

1427
01:52:29,158 --> 01:52:29,992
It works.

1428
01:52:30,159 --> 01:52:31,744
Of course it works, Miss Shaw.

1429
01:52:34,455 --> 01:52:35,664
Mathematics works.

1430
01:52:36,832 --> 01:52:39,835
As it conquered space, it will conquer time.

1431
01:52:47,718 --> 01:52:49,637
You've already lost your son, Dr. Jones.

1432
01:52:49,845 --> 01:52:50,721
Your wife is gone.

1433
01:52:50,929 --> 01:52:52,848
Do you really want to lose your godchild?

1434
01:52:55,935 --> 01:52:57,019
For what?

1435
01:52:57,394 --> 01:52:59,521
A world that no longer cares
about men like us.

1436
01:53:11,075 --> 01:53:11,951
Thank you.

1437
01:53:50,573 --> 01:53:51,991
History's greatest moment.

1438
01:53:59,081 --> 01:54:00,332
Its end.

1439
01:54:08,173 --> 01:54:09,091
Throw me the gun!

1440
01:54:19,435 --> 01:54:20,686
Get him outta here.

1441
01:54:20,853 --> 01:54:21,687
Teddy.

1442
01:54:22,730 --> 01:54:23,898
Teddy! Teddy!

1443
01:54:24,023 --> 01:54:25,107
Come on! Go!

1444
01:54:25,274 --> 01:54:26,150
This way. Come on.

1445
01:54:30,237 --> 01:54:31,113
Go!

1446
01:54:35,492 --> 01:54:36,410
Indy!

1447
01:54:38,412 --> 01:54:39,538
Go!

1448
01:54:39,663 --> 01:54:40,956
Go!

1449
01:54:41,165 --> 01:54:42,249
Stop!

1450
01:54:45,586 --> 01:54:47,004
Now what?

1451
01:54:48,631 --> 01:54:49,632
Bring him.

1452
01:54:57,681 --> 01:54:58,682
Helena, come on!

1453
01:54:58,933 --> 01:55:00,267
-Teddy, we can't just leave him.
-We're not!

1454
01:55:00,434 --> 01:55:01,560
Follow me!

1455
01:55:03,562 --> 01:55:04,563
Come on!

1456
01:55:08,484 --> 01:55:09,360
Come on.

1457
01:55:23,707 --> 01:55:25,668
Teddy. Come on. We've got a car.

1458
01:55:30,631 --> 01:55:31,590
Crap.

1459
01:55:37,805 --> 01:55:38,848
Stay there.

1460
01:55:57,741 --> 01:55:58,742
Hop on.

1461
01:56:02,371 --> 01:56:05,291
The first hemisphere sets the destination.

1462
01:56:06,792 --> 01:56:10,379
The second calculates the location
of the fissure...

1463
01:56:11,589 --> 01:56:13,465
in Alexandrine coordinates.

1464
01:56:14,091 --> 01:56:16,886
Have Messner transpose this
to longitude and latitude...

1465
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:19,805
and transmit waypoints to the pilots.

1466
01:56:32,026 --> 01:56:33,486
Shortcut.

1467
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:42,203
-You got coordinates for 37.07.
-So, who is it?

1468
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:44,205
Churchill?

1469
01:56:45,539 --> 01:56:46,540
Ike?

1470
01:56:48,834 --> 01:56:51,337
Who are you gonna kill to win the war?

1471
01:56:52,171 --> 01:56:55,090
In a few minutes,
with the help of Archimedes...

1472
01:56:55,216 --> 01:56:57,134
we shall fly into the eye of this storm...

1473
01:56:57,885 --> 01:57:00,179
and cross into Sicilian airspace...

1474
01:57:00,346 --> 01:57:03,766
on August 20th, 1939.

1475
01:57:04,517 --> 01:57:08,104
We will head north over friendly skies
with enough fuel to reach Munich.

1476
01:57:09,438 --> 01:57:11,023
My quarry will be waiting for me...

1477
01:57:11,190 --> 01:57:14,026
at 16 Prinzregentenplatz...

1478
01:57:14,443 --> 01:57:16,612
for an update on his V-1 rocket.

1479
01:57:23,577 --> 01:57:27,540
What kind of Nazi kills the Führer?

1480
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:31,836
The kind that believes in victory, Dr. Jones.

1481
01:57:37,133 --> 01:57:40,970
Hitler lit a fire that could have burned
1,000 years.

1482
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:42,638
I saw every mistake.

1483
01:57:43,431 --> 01:57:44,723
Every blunder.

1484
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:46,559
And I will correct them all.

1485
01:57:46,684 --> 01:57:49,353
History is a long list of losses, Dr. Jones.

1486
01:57:50,396 --> 01:57:51,605
It's just a question of whose.

1487
01:58:04,326 --> 01:58:05,327
Stop!

1488
01:59:18,526 --> 01:59:19,318
Teddy.

1489
01:59:21,153 --> 01:59:22,154
You think you can fly one of those?

1490
01:59:24,323 --> 01:59:25,199
A Nord?

1491
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:28,828
Sure.

1492
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:30,705
It's not a ringing response.

1493
01:59:30,871 --> 01:59:32,581
Well, I haven't flown a Nord.

1494
01:59:32,665 --> 01:59:34,291
You've never flown any plane.

1495
01:59:36,085 --> 01:59:37,294
I'll get it started.

1496
01:59:37,461 --> 01:59:38,713
No, Teddy.

1497
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:40,881
Crap.

1498
02:00:08,242 --> 02:00:09,827
Fasten your seat belt, Dr. Jones.

1499
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:11,329
There might be some turbulence.

1500
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:14,707
You're German, Voller.

1501
02:00:14,915 --> 02:00:16,917
Don't try and be funny.

1502
02:00:40,358 --> 02:00:42,151
Come on, big talker.

1503
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:57,959
Okay.

1504
02:01:14,767 --> 02:01:16,435
Okay. Okay.

1505
02:01:16,602 --> 02:01:19,063
Gauges green. Power full.

1506
02:01:19,814 --> 02:01:22,275
And when I reach 85, I rotate.

1507
02:01:59,979 --> 02:02:01,480
Okay, wings down.

1508
02:02:03,566 --> 02:02:05,568
Okay, 84 miles an hour.

1509
02:02:05,943 --> 02:02:06,902
Rotate.

1510
02:03:14,845 --> 02:03:16,138
Time to destination?

1511
02:03:17,431 --> 02:03:18,891
60 seconds.

1512
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:25,773
Continental drift.

1513
02:03:29,151 --> 02:03:30,319
Continental drift!

1514
02:03:32,113 --> 02:03:34,699
Archimedes didn't know
about continental drift.

1515
02:03:35,533 --> 02:03:36,784
He couldn't have!

1516
02:03:37,785 --> 02:03:39,704
It hadn't been observed yet.

1517
02:03:40,746 --> 02:03:42,540
You're off target.

1518
02:03:42,915 --> 02:03:44,876
Your coordinates are based on markers...

1519
02:03:45,626 --> 02:03:48,838
that have been moving for 2000 years!

1520
02:03:48,963 --> 02:03:52,341
You could be off by 10 degrees, by...

1521
02:04:07,356 --> 02:04:08,941
30 seconds.

1522
02:04:10,151 --> 02:04:10,985
Herr Voller...

1523
02:04:11,152 --> 02:04:13,946
Your calculations are wrong!

1524
02:04:14,489 --> 02:04:15,698
-Herr Voller...
-Will you shut up?

1525
02:04:16,282 --> 02:04:17,283
I'm thinking!

1526
02:04:20,286 --> 02:04:21,204
20 seconds.

1527
02:04:23,956 --> 02:04:25,082
Hold the flight path!

1528
02:04:27,043 --> 02:04:28,377
15 seconds.

1529
02:04:31,923 --> 02:04:33,341
I don't know where we're going, Jürgen.

1530
02:04:33,591 --> 02:04:34,342
10 seconds.

1531
02:04:35,259 --> 02:04:36,010
9!

1532
02:04:36,093 --> 02:04:37,595
-But it sure as hell...
-8!

1533
02:04:38,137 --> 02:04:39,680
-7!
-...ain't 1939!

1534
02:04:39,764 --> 02:04:40,515
6!

1535
02:04:40,598 --> 02:04:41,891
Turn around!

1536
02:04:42,558 --> 02:04:43,392
Abort!

1537
02:04:43,976 --> 02:04:44,727
Turn around!

1538
02:04:45,645 --> 02:04:46,395
ABORT!!!

1539
02:04:46,771 --> 02:04:48,731
We're being pulled in!

1540
02:04:58,783 --> 02:05:00,034
What are you doing?!

1541
02:05:00,243 --> 02:05:01,077
This is my plane!

1542
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:02,829
You're flying my plane!

1543
02:05:27,645 --> 02:05:28,813
We're going to DIE!!!

1544
02:05:30,106 --> 02:05:31,858
We need to pull up!

1545
02:05:53,713 --> 02:05:54,881
Restart engines!

1546
02:06:23,493 --> 02:06:24,619
That's Sicily.

1547
02:06:24,786 --> 02:06:26,037
1939.

1548
02:06:27,747 --> 02:06:29,165
I did it.

1549
02:06:29,332 --> 02:06:30,833
I did it, Dr. Jones!

1550
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,752
Setting coordinates for Munich.

1551
02:06:39,717 --> 02:06:41,761
Yesterday belongs to us, Dr. Jones.

1552
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:08,830
Those are Roman triremes.

1553
02:07:37,066 --> 02:07:38,234
Keep it in the air!

1554
02:07:58,379 --> 02:07:59,130
Master...

1555
02:07:59,339 --> 02:08:01,758
The Romans are getting closer.

1556
02:08:03,509 --> 02:08:04,385
They have dragons!

1557
02:08:09,098 --> 02:08:10,475
Amazing.

1558
02:08:19,984 --> 02:08:20,943
Open the door!

1559
02:08:25,865 --> 02:08:26,866
What are you doing?

1560
02:08:27,825 --> 02:08:29,535
What are you doing, you idiots?

1561
02:08:29,702 --> 02:08:31,496
They think we're a monster!

1562
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:39,420
You have to turn around.

1563
02:08:39,629 --> 02:08:41,506
This is the Siege of Syracuse.

1564
02:08:42,674 --> 02:08:44,050
214 BC.

1565
02:08:44,175 --> 02:08:45,343
You got the wrong war.

1566
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:49,931
Master...

1567
02:08:53,393 --> 02:08:54,602
Don't ride out there, Master!

1568
02:08:55,269 --> 02:08:56,437
The dragons!!

1569
02:09:06,698 --> 02:09:10,243
We must take down their dragons!

1570
02:09:17,375 --> 02:09:18,251
Boss!

1571
02:09:18,376 --> 02:09:19,252
Change course!

1572
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:20,837
The portal closes in minutes!

1573
02:09:21,296 --> 02:09:22,171
I have to go back!

1574
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:23,798
I can't be here!

1575
02:09:23,965 --> 02:09:25,049
I CAN'T STAY HERE!!

1576
02:09:25,216 --> 02:09:26,676
The plane won't make it!!

1577
02:09:56,414 --> 02:09:57,332
Get out of the way!

1578
02:10:03,671 --> 02:10:05,840
How do you like that, you savages?

1579
02:10:08,885 --> 02:10:11,638
Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!

1580
02:10:21,689 --> 02:10:23,775
What are you doing here?

1581
02:10:23,983 --> 02:10:25,443
Rescuing you!

1582
02:10:37,038 --> 02:10:37,914
Get him off!

1583
02:10:39,290 --> 02:10:40,333
Indy!

1584
02:10:46,047 --> 02:10:47,215
Parachute!

1585
02:10:50,051 --> 02:10:51,219
I got a parachute!

1586
02:10:52,637 --> 02:10:53,471
Hang on!

1587
02:10:57,350 --> 02:10:58,226
Let go!

1588
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:01,938
Give me the parachute!

1589
02:11:08,027 --> 02:11:10,154
Grab it. Hang on!

1590
02:11:12,532 --> 02:11:13,366
Indy!

1591
02:11:40,727 --> 02:11:42,270
We're losing altitude!

1592
02:11:43,479 --> 02:11:44,439
We're going down!

1593
02:11:46,357 --> 02:11:47,901
I've lost control!

1594
02:12:06,169 --> 02:12:08,546
Hey, those are my friends.

1595
02:12:08,713 --> 02:12:10,757
Those are my friends. We need to help them!

1596
02:12:11,966 --> 02:12:13,551
Those are my friends!

1597
02:13:15,446 --> 02:13:16,781
Eureka.

1598
02:13:34,048 --> 02:13:34,883
He's trying to land.

1599
02:13:35,091 --> 02:13:37,093
Come on, Indy. Help me.

1600
02:13:37,802 --> 02:13:39,846
Get up. Yeah.

1601
02:13:40,054 --> 02:13:42,348
We need to get you out of here. Okay.

1602
02:13:44,267 --> 02:13:45,518
Help me. Sit up, okay?

1603
02:13:46,436 --> 02:13:47,604
Sit up. You need to help me.

1604
02:13:47,770 --> 02:13:49,689
I know it hurts, but we gotta get you back.

1605
02:13:49,814 --> 02:13:52,567
This is incredible, Wombat.

1606
02:13:53,109 --> 02:13:55,069
Incredible.

1607
02:13:56,613 --> 02:13:58,323
Yeah, it very well is.

1608
02:13:58,490 --> 02:14:00,116
But we have to get you out of here.

1609
02:14:02,202 --> 02:14:03,328
My God.

1610
02:14:04,996 --> 02:14:06,831
We're witnessing history.

1611
02:14:13,922 --> 02:14:15,757
Reverse these numbers.

1612
02:14:15,882 --> 02:14:16,966
They'll get you home.

1613
02:14:18,843 --> 02:14:19,677
What?

1614
02:14:22,597 --> 02:14:23,807
I'm going to stay.

1615
02:14:24,557 --> 02:14:26,559
No. You're not serious.

1616
02:14:29,395 --> 02:14:30,438
Wow, you are serious.

1617
02:14:34,526 --> 02:14:36,277
Indy, you've been shot.

1618
02:14:36,444 --> 02:14:37,278
You're bleeding.

1619
02:14:37,612 --> 02:14:39,239
You can't stay here.

1620
02:14:39,405 --> 02:14:40,281
Yes, I can.

1621
02:14:40,865 --> 02:14:41,825
But for what?

1622
02:14:41,991 --> 02:14:45,620
For a long, painful death
with poultice and leeches?

1623
02:14:46,621 --> 02:14:48,748
I've imagined this, Wombat.

1624
02:14:49,833 --> 02:14:51,626
Studied it.

1625
02:14:51,835 --> 02:14:53,878
-All my life.
-Yeah.

1626
02:14:54,045 --> 02:14:57,173
And if you stay here,
you will muck it all up.

1627
02:14:57,340 --> 02:14:58,174
And die.

1628
02:14:58,842 --> 02:15:00,552
Please, get up.

1629
02:15:02,303 --> 02:15:03,471
Helena!

1630
02:15:03,930 --> 02:15:04,764
I did it!

1631
02:15:04,889 --> 02:15:07,267
Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!

1632
02:15:07,475 --> 02:15:08,935
Okay. Indy, we've gotta go. Get up.

1633
02:15:09,144 --> 02:15:10,645
-I need to get you into that plane, okay?
-No.

1634
02:15:10,770 --> 02:15:11,688
-We need to.
-No.

1635
02:15:11,855 --> 02:15:13,481
Get up. You can... We can!

1636
02:15:26,661 --> 02:15:27,412
Master!

1637
02:15:30,165 --> 02:15:31,916
We have to leave, Master.

1638
02:15:33,626 --> 02:15:34,627
It's him.

1639
02:15:43,553 --> 02:15:45,597
He's asking how far we've come.

1640
02:15:48,975 --> 02:15:51,728
Two thousand years.

1641
02:15:52,437 --> 02:15:53,605
We've come...

1642
02:15:54,147 --> 02:15:57,150
two thousand years.

1643
02:15:59,527 --> 02:16:02,655
But we didn't expect to meet...

1644
02:16:03,156 --> 02:16:05,658
the great...

1645
02:16:06,242 --> 02:16:08,286
Archimedes.

1646
02:16:13,875 --> 02:16:14,793
You...

1647
02:16:16,002 --> 02:16:17,420
were always...

1648
02:16:18,004 --> 02:16:19,339
going to...

1649
02:16:19,839 --> 02:16:21,508
meet me.

1650
02:16:22,217 --> 02:16:24,010
That dial is a forced deck.

1651
02:16:24,177 --> 02:16:25,637
It doesn't take us anywhere but here.

1652
02:16:25,762 --> 02:16:27,055
He built it to get help.

1653
02:16:27,222 --> 02:16:29,766
Well, we just scared off
the entire Roman Navy...

1654
02:16:29,933 --> 02:16:30,850
so I think we've helped enough.

1655
02:16:31,059 --> 02:16:32,686
Apologies, Archimedes.

1656
02:16:32,894 --> 02:16:34,270
I'm a fan...

1657
02:16:34,479 --> 02:16:36,523
but we need to leave. He's hurt.

1658
02:16:36,648 --> 02:16:37,565
Helena...

1659
02:16:37,691 --> 02:16:38,692
He can't keep that, by the way.

1660
02:16:38,858 --> 02:16:39,734
He needs to build his own one.

1661
02:16:39,901 --> 02:16:41,695
Helena, we need to go!

1662
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:44,239
Indy, the window is closing!

1663
02:16:44,447 --> 02:16:45,573
We cannot get stuck here!

1664
02:16:46,992 --> 02:16:47,742
I want...

1665
02:16:47,867 --> 02:16:48,952
to stay...

1666
02:16:49,327 --> 02:16:51,079
with you.

1667
02:16:51,246 --> 02:16:53,206
No, no, no! Do not say yes!

1668
02:16:53,790 --> 02:16:56,042
You are a brilliant man...

1669
02:16:56,334 --> 02:16:58,336
a wise man...

1670
02:16:58,795 --> 02:17:00,171
a genius...

1671
02:17:00,380 --> 02:17:01,172
Helena...

1672
02:17:01,381 --> 02:17:03,675
a hero to your people.

1673
02:17:04,426 --> 02:17:07,887
But he can't help you.

1674
02:17:08,972 --> 02:17:10,765
This is your time.

1675
02:17:10,890 --> 02:17:11,641
This is your time.

1676
02:17:11,766 --> 02:17:13,768
He must be in his own time -

1677
02:17:13,893 --> 02:17:14,978
He needs to be in his.

1678
02:17:15,103 --> 02:17:16,104
His work is not done.

1679
02:17:16,479 --> 02:17:17,439
He needs to go home.

1680
02:17:17,605 --> 02:17:19,190
There is medicine at home.

1681
02:17:19,357 --> 02:17:21,151
He cannot die here. He can't.

1682
02:17:22,777 --> 02:17:25,655
Helena, get on the plane.

1683
02:17:28,283 --> 02:17:29,367
I'll be all right.

1684
02:17:31,119 --> 02:17:32,579
No, you won't.

1685
02:17:35,498 --> 02:17:37,167
I need to do this.

1686
02:17:38,460 --> 02:17:39,294
Me too.

1687
02:18:33,932 --> 02:18:34,808
Good morning.

1688
02:18:39,688 --> 02:18:41,022
How's the shoulder?

1689
02:18:43,733 --> 02:18:46,194
Better than my jaw.

1690
02:18:49,864 --> 02:18:50,865
Right.

1691
02:18:52,867 --> 02:18:54,369
You should've let me stay.

1692
02:18:55,203 --> 02:18:56,454
I couldn't do that.

1693
02:19:05,505 --> 02:19:06,423
Why not?

1694
02:19:08,383 --> 02:19:10,844
Well, for starters, you'd have changed
the course of history.

1695
02:19:15,181 --> 02:19:17,017
That's supposed to be a bad thing?

1696
02:19:21,146 --> 02:19:22,939
You're meant to be here, Indy.

1697
02:19:26,818 --> 02:19:27,652
Here.

1698
02:19:32,866 --> 02:19:33,950
For who?

1699
02:20:01,269 --> 02:20:02,938
Marion.

1700
02:20:04,105 --> 02:20:05,148
Hey.

1701
02:20:24,584 --> 02:20:25,502
Teddy.

1702
02:20:27,045 --> 02:20:28,004
Marion.

1703
02:20:30,882 --> 02:20:31,842
What are you doing?

1704
02:20:33,301 --> 02:20:34,511
Putting groceries away.

1705
02:20:36,805 --> 02:20:39,516
There wasn't a scrap of food in this place.

1706
02:20:40,475 --> 02:20:42,477
No. Really.

1707
02:20:47,190 --> 02:20:49,484
Someone told me you were back.

1708
02:20:56,950 --> 02:20:58,535
Are you back, Indy?

1709
02:21:00,162 --> 02:21:01,913
It was explosives...

1710
02:21:02,038 --> 02:21:04,166
and Indy was running,
Marion was running...

1711
02:21:04,332 --> 02:21:06,960
and suddenly the plane exploded.

1712
02:21:10,755 --> 02:21:12,799
Indy, you're up and about.

1713
02:21:13,967 --> 02:21:15,302
Yes, I am.

1714
02:21:16,678 --> 02:21:17,470
Yes.

1715
02:21:18,054 --> 02:21:20,140
Why don't we go and get some ice cream, kids?

1716
02:21:20,265 --> 02:21:21,558
But Marion just bought some.

1717
02:21:21,766 --> 02:21:22,851
Oh, I know a better place.

1718
02:21:23,018 --> 02:21:25,187
You can never have too much ice cream,
can you?

1719
02:21:29,065 --> 02:21:29,900
See you later.

1720
02:21:33,069 --> 02:21:36,406
A British tar is a soaring soul

1721
02:21:36,615 --> 02:21:39,367
As free as a mountain bird

1722
02:21:39,618 --> 02:21:41,369
His energetic fist

1723
02:21:41,620 --> 02:21:44,039
Should be ready to resist...

1724
02:21:45,916 --> 02:21:47,167
That looks bad.

1725
02:21:48,668 --> 02:21:49,961
Does it hurt?

1726
02:21:52,464 --> 02:21:53,924
Everything hurts.

1727
02:21:56,802 --> 02:21:58,428
I know how that feels.

1728
02:22:04,559 --> 02:22:07,145
Well, where doesn't it hurt?

1729
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:16,154
Here.

1730
02:22:17,531 --> 02:22:18,782
It doesn't hurt here.

1731
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:28,625
And here.

1732
02:22:52,149 --> 02:22:54,609
Jabari, Alia, slow down!

1733
02:22:54,776 --> 02:22:56,903
Helena! Hurry up!

1734
02:22:57,070 --> 02:22:59,739
I scream, you scream...

1735
02:22:59,906 --> 02:23:01,616
Everybody, slow down.

1736
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:04,161
-I scream, you scream
-I scream, I scream

1737
02:23:04,327 --> 02:23:06,079
We all scream for ice cream!

1738
02:23:06,204 --> 02:23:07,372
Slow down.
